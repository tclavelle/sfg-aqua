## Update: Mapping Global Marine Aquaculture
Starting at the beginning of 2016, SFG embarked on a project to estimate the join production possibilities from wild fisheries and aquaculture. The goal of this project is to explore the tradeoffs between the two sectors and how they can inform policy decisions. Our previous research identified one point on the tradeoff fronteir - the global potential production from wild fisheries (Costello *et al.* 2016). Unfortunately, despite mariculture's clear role in global food security, SFG identified a lack of basic spatial knowledge about the sector, and no global map of marine aquaculture currently exists. This information is critical to fully understanding the tradeoffs between aquaculture and wild fisheries and where production should be expanded or restrained. However, we've identified this key data gap to be a great opportunity and have begun exploring potential partnerships, data sources, and methodologies for producing the world's first global map of marine aquaculture. This map would be a major achievement and a key step towards estimating the maximum potential food from the sea. It could dramatically improve the ability for researchers and managers to study and steward marine resources moving forward.

### Proposed Approach
Publicly available datasets, such as from the Sentinel 2 satellites, may not be sufficient for such an analysis (Figure 1). However, we have a verbal MOU with Digital Globe, who provide cutting edge satellite imagery and data products (Figure 2). With this data, SFG is confident that we can design an accurate and reproducible methodology for mapping global aquaculture. We have also held preliminary talks with the FAO, who are very interested in the project, and Google, who's Earth Engine platform could provide the required computing resources. 

We are developing a proposed approach to this project that builds off the aquaculture suitability modeling work previously done by Becca Gentry. A crowd-sourcing campaign would analyze suitable aquaculture areas to identify and verify existing farms, and machine learning algorithms that automate detection, monitor expansion, estimate productivity, and observe the environmental conditions at the global level would be explored.

##### Project Steps:
1. SFG uses Becca Gentry's suitability analysis to identify areas to manually search for existing aquaculture farms

2. SFG oversees a crowd-sourcing campaign to identify existing farms within the suitable area determined in step 1

3. Identified farms are cross-referenced with data on farm location provided by FAO and other management bodies

4. Where possible, data on farm location is supplemented with information on species, farm type (e.g. floating pen, cage, mussel line, etc), productivity, and other useful variables

5. Develop machine learning algorithms to assist with future identification (and possibly classification) of aquaculture globally
