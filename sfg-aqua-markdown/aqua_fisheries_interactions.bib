	abstract = {The farming of salmon and other marine finfish in open net pens continues to increase along the world's coastlines as the aquaculture industry expands to meet human demand. Farm fish are known to escape from pens in all salmon aquaculture areas. Their escape into the wild can result in interbreeding and competition with wild salmon and can facilitate the spread of pathogens, thereby placing more pressure on already dwindling wild populations. Here we assess the ecological, genetic, and socioeconomic impacts of farm salmon escapes, using a risk-assessment framework. We show that risks of damage to wild salmon populations, ecosystems, and society are large when salmon are farmed in their native range, when large numbers of salmon are farmed relative to the size of wild populations, and when exotic pathogens are introduced. We then evaluate the policy and management options for reducing risks and discuss the implications for farming other types of marine finfish.},

We develop a framework to clarify the choice of the optimal scale of aquaculture when that use impacts a commercial fishery. We identify a range of potential impacts, both positive and negative, and analyze how one or more might affect the carrying capacity of a fish stock. We conduct a numerical simulation to illustrate a case where aquaculture and fishery uses interact in the ocean and compete in the product market, and we find that an ocean area could be devoted exclusively to aquaculture. This result depends strongly upon assumptions about the nature of the interaction, the geographic distribution of fish, and the aquaculture production technology. We also investigate the behavior of the model when both uses are able to coexist.},

In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80\% of MSY.},

	abstract = {Data from 4,713 fisheries worldwide, representing 78\% of global reported fish catch, are analyzed to estimate the status, trends, and benefits of alternative approaches to recovering depleted fisheries. For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

population-dynamics and production, coupled with an aquaculture production model, to investigate

capacity, intrinsic growth rate or catchability coefficient in the fishery depend on aquaculture production.
We find that the different externalities can give opposite effects on steady state fishing effort, yield and
stock, even for only \_negative\_ externalities. With a catchability externality, for social optimum,
increased unit cost of fishing can imply reduced aquaculture production under reasonable assumptions.
We also look at allocation between the industries under three different management regimes for coastal
areas: 1) Aquaculture has a primary right of use; 2) Optimal management of aquaculture and fishery; 3)
Fishers have a primary right of use, but may allow marine farming, possibly against payment.},

	abstract = {Using estimates of the primary production required (PPR) to support fisheries catches (a measure of the footprint of fishing), we analyzed the geographical expansion of the global marine fisheries from 1950 to 2005. We used multiple threshold levels of PPR as percentage of local primary production to define ‘fisheries exploitation’ and applied them to the global dataset of spatially-explicit marine fisheries catches. This approach enabled us to assign exploitation status across a 0.5° latitude/longitude ocean grid system and trace the change in their status over the 56-year time period. This result highlights the global scale expansion in marine fisheries, from the coastal waters off North Atlantic and West Pacific to the waters in the Southern Hemisphere and into the high seas. The southward expansion of fisheries occurred at a rate of almost one degree latitude per year, with the greatest period of expansion occurring in the 1980s and early 1990s. By the mid 1990s, a third of the world's ocean, and two-thirds of continental shelves, were exploited at a level where PPR of fisheries exceed 10\% of PP, leaving only unproductive waters of high seas, and relatively inaccessible waters in the Arctic and Antarctic as the last remaining ‘frontiers.’ The growth in marine fisheries catches for more than half a century was only made possible through exploitation of new fishing grounds. Their rapidly diminishing number indicates a global limit to growth and highlights the urgent need for a transition to sustainable fishing through reduction of PPR.},

CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute takes pride in being first for pioneering Kappaphycus alvarezii cultivation, heralding an era of commercial seaweed farming in India. The invention of liquefying fresh seaweed biomass to obtain two products in an integrated manner, one being a granular residue rich in κ-carrageenan and the other being sap rich in potash and micronutrients (ca. 2 \% w/v), with proven efficacy has provided a boost to commercial farming. The production has been substantially increased from 21 dry tonnes in 2001 to 1490 dry tonnes in 2013 with concomitant purchase value of {\textless}4.5 to 35 Rs kg−1 (dry). India is fast emerging as important production center in Southeast Asia for K. alvarezii production with estimated 765,000 man-days of employment, having annual turnover of around Rs 2 billion. At present, commercial farming is carried out following three techniques, namely floating bamboo raft, tube net, and longline method of which former two are widely practiced. The cultivation activity is well established in southern state of Tamil Nadu and progressing rapidly to other areas namely Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The socioeconomic benefits accrued in this project are overwhelmingly positive, but evidence-based policies are required for addressing prevailing environmental issues. The steps toward developing value-added products with niche applications coupled with biotechnological interventions aimed at seed production through tissue culture for developing elite germplasm, etc. could further improve the prospects of taking this project to pan India level. The present review provides a detailed account of developments of commercial farming that has witnessed successful diversification of livelihood consistently for the last 10 years.},

	abstract = {Commercially valuable sea cucumbers are potential co-culture species in tropical lagoon environments, where they may be integrated into established aquaculture areas used for seaweed farming. In the current study, wild-caught juvenile sea cucumbers, Holothuria scabra, and red seaweed Kappaphycus striatum were co-cultured on Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania. Sea cucumbers (97 g ± 31 SD, n = 52) were cultured in mesh enclosures at initial cage stocking densities of 124 ± 21 SD and 218 ± 16 SD g m−2 under seaweed culture lines. Over 83 days, individual growth rate (1.6 g d−1 ± 0.2 SD) of sea cucumbers at low stocking density was significantly higher (χ2 = 8.292, d.f. = 1, P = 0.004) than at high-stocking density (0.9 g d−1 ± 0.1 SD). Seaweed individual growth rates [6.27 (±0.3 SE) g d−1] were highest in co-culture with sea cucumber at low density but did not differ significantly from high sea cucumber density or seaweed monoculture treatments (χ2 = 3.0885, d.f. = 2, P = 0.2135). Seaweed growth varied significantly (χ2 = 35.6, d.f. = 2, P {\textless} 0.0001) with sampling period, with the final sampling period resulting in the highest growth rate. Growth performance for seaweed and sea cucumbers (χ2 = 3.089, d.f. = 2, P = 0.21 and χ2 = 0.08, d.f. = 1, P = 0.777 respectively), did not differ significantly between monoculture and co-culture treatments, yet growth in co-culture was comparable with that reported for existing commercial monoculture. Results indicate H. scabra is a highly viable candidate species for lagoon co-culture with seaweed. Co-culture offers a more efficient use of limited coastal space over monoculture and is recommended as a potential coastal livelihood option for lagoon farmers in tropical regions.},

In this study, we investigate whether this lack of market integration between wild and farmed conspecifics for European seabass and gilthead seabream in Southern European countries is specific for these species or is representative for the area. Therefore, we investigate the existence of market integration in Spain between wild and farmed conspecifics for a large variety of different species: turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), sole (Solea spp.), blackspot (red) seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and meagre (Argyrosomus regius).},

The introduction of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) into fisheries represents an attempt to correct this failure. ITQs, however, are not property rights in the relevant natural resources, i.e. the fish stocks and their habitat. They are merely harvesting rights and thus far from ideal as property rights. Nevertheless, ITQs have been introduced in numerous fisheries around the world, apparently with generally, even consistently, good economic results. This paper outlines the basic theory of property rights and the strengths and weaknesses of ITQs as property rights in fisheries. The paper goes on to discuss the Icelandic ITQ system and compares its property rights value with that of the New Zealand ITQ system and the Norwegian IQ system. Finally, the paper reviews some measures of the economic outcomes of the ITQ system in Iceland.},

Locating aquaculture offshore is one strategy that may help address some issues related to nearshore development. However, offshore production is nascent and distinctions between the types of aquatic farming may not be fully understood by the public–important for collaboration, research, and development. Here we evaluate and report, to our knowledge, the first multinational quantification of the relative sentiments and opinions of the public around distinct forms of aquaculture. Using thousands of newspaper headlines (Ntotal = 1,596) from developed (no. countries = 26) and developing (42) nations, ranging over periods of 1984 to 2015, we found an expanding positive trend of general ‘aquaculture’ coverage, while ‘marine’ and ‘offshore’ appeared more negative. Overall, developing regions published proportionally more positive than negative headlines than developed countries. As case studies, government collected public comments (Ntotal = 1,585) from the United States of America (USA) and New Zealand mirrored the media sentiments; offshore perception being particularly negative in the USA. We also found public sentiment may be influenced by local environmental disasters not directly related to aquaculture (e.g., oil spills). Both countries voiced concern over environmental impacts, but the concerns tended to be more generalized, rather than targeted issues. Two factors that could be inhibiting informed discussion and decisions about offshore aquaculture are lack of applicable knowledge and actual local development issues. Better communication and investigation of the real versus perceived impacts of aquaculture could aid in clarifying the debate about aquaculture, and help support future sustainable growth.},

Mangroves enhance fisheries and coastal protection, and store among the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem globally. Mangrove forests have experienced extensive deforestation owing to global demand for commodities, and previous studies have identified the expansion of aquaculture as largely responsible. The proportional conversion of mangroves to different land use types has not been systematically quantified across Southeast Asia, however, particularly in recent years. In this study we apply a combined geographic information system and remote sensing method to quantify the key proximate drivers (i.e., replacement land uses) of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2012. Mangrove forests were lost at an average rate of 0.18\% per year, which is lower than previously published estimates. In total, more than 100,000 ha of mangroves were removed during the study period, with aquaculture accounting for 30\% of this total forest change. The rapid expansion of rice agriculture in Myanmar, and the sustained conversion of mangroves to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, are identified as additional increasing and under-recognized threats to mangrove ecosystems. Our study highlights frontiers of mangrove deforestation in the border states of Myanmar, on Borneo, and in Indonesian Papua. To implement policies that conserve mangrove forests across Southeast Asia, it is essential to consider the national and subnational variation in the land uses that follow deforestation.},

Previous documented attempts to restore mangroves, where successful, have largely concentrated on creation of plantations of mangroves consisting of just a few species, and targeted for harvesting as wood products, or temporarily used to collect eroded soil and raise intertidal areas to usable terrestrial agricultural uses. I document here the importance of assessing the existing hydrology of natural extant mangrove ecosystems, and applying this knowledge to first protect existing mangroves, and second to achieve successful and cost-effective ecological restoration, if needed. Previous research has documented the general principle that mangrove forests worldwide exist largely in a raised and sloped platform above mean sea level, and inundated at approximately 30\%, or less of the time by tidal waters. More frequent flooding causes stress and death of these tree species. Prevention of such damage requires application of the same understanding of mangrove hydrology.},

	abstract = {Mangrove species are uniquely adapted to tropical and subtropical coasts, and although relatively low in number of species, mangrove forests provide at least US \$1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods worldwide. Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16\%) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40\% of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced.},

	abstract = {Globally aquaculture has been increasing rapidly and already accounts for nearly half of all food fish consumed. For developing countries, which produce 90\% of the world’s output, aquaculture is a source of protein, employment, income and of foreign exchange. Southeast Asia is an area which has experienced this “blue revolution”. Total aquaculture output in the region increased from less than two million tonnes in 1990 to more than eight million tonnes in 2006. Moreover, the region’s pace of expansion has accelerated. Annual average growth rates in output from 2000 to 2006 were more than double those from 1990 to 2000. Already more than a quarter of food fish in Southeast Asia comes from aquaculture.
Aquaculture matters because fish products are important in the diet of much of Southeast Asia. The population generally has a high per capita consumption of fish, and fish are a major source of animal protein in a region where levels of animal protein are below the world average. Output from the capture fisheries has increased but growth rates are slowing. To maintain present levels of per capita consumption of fish in the region, whose average population is projected to grow by 16\% by 2015, requires continued expansion of aquaculture.
The paper focuses on commercial or profit-oriented aquaculture. It produces protein, but also rural employment and income. It also has the potential to generate taxes for governments and foreign exchange, and by improving economic efficiencies and competitiveness hold down the cost of aquatic products. Contributing to food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth, aquaculture is an important and growing sector in the region and merits study. It is hoped that lessons learnt can be useful to other parts of the world.},

We derived the fractions used for each for 1950–2010 by fishing country, and thus provide a factual foundation for discussions of the optimal use of fisheries resources. From 1950 to 2010, 27\% ({\textasciitilde}20 million tonnes annually) of globally reconstructed marine fisheries landings were destined for uses other than DHC. Importantly, 90\% of fish destined for uses other than DHC are food-grade or prime food-grade fish, while fish without a ready market for DHC make up a much smaller proportion. These findings have implications for how we are using fish to feed ourselves or, more appropriately, how we are not using fish to feed ourselves.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the seafood sector in Indonesia, using fish supply-demand modeling, with special focus on the growing role of aquaculture in the country's food portfolio. The paper describes six scenarios for future fish supply–demand dynamics and examines the role of aquaculture growth in fish supply in Indonesia. A business as usual scenario (BAU) assumed exogenous variables of our supply-demand model following historical trends. Five alternative scenarios explored the implications of stagnant capture fisheries; export-oriented growth of aquaculture; domestic-oriented aquaculture growth; slow growth of aquaculture sector; and disease outbreaks to key aquaculture species. The BAU scenario projected that fish supply and demand in Indonesia continues to increase over time and strong aquaculture growth is critical to meet increasing demand for fish. Stagnant capture fisheries resulted in increasing fish prices and decreasing fish consumption. Export-oriented aquaculture growth benefitted fish supply and exports, but also helped lower domestic prices and thus increase consumption. An emphasis on domestic aquaculture commodities increased fish supply, providing best domestic consumption outcomes and lower consumer prices. Slow aquaculture growth reduced fish supply and led to undesirable increases in domestic prices and decreasing domestic consumption as a consequence. Disease outbreaks in shrimp and carp aquaculture resulted in a short-term reduction in aquaculture output and increasing fish prices, lowering fish consumption.},

The papers used covered a wide range of farmed species, geographic regions, management practices and specific site characteristics (e.g., depth, exposure, and sediment type). Therefore, the total data-set may not be considered as biased towards a particular set of conditions as is often the case with data collected in a single study. More than 120 biological and geochemical variables were monitored, occasionally using different sampling and analytical protocols for the same variables. The rank correlation analysis between all possible pairs of variables in the data set showed a large number of significant positive or negative correlations, reflecting the response of these variables to benthic organic enrichment. The use of stepwise regression showed that most biological and geochemical variables are determined by a combination of distance from the farm with bottom depth and/or latitude. Results of stepwise regression, repeated separately for each type of sediment, showed that although the general pattern was similar among different types of sediments, the coefficients varied considerably indicating changes of the distance affected by settling particulate organic material for different sediment types. The overall conclusion is that the complicated interactions between variables and the lack of data, such as current speed, induce difficulties in setting common or uniform environmental quality standards for benthic effects of fish farming and these should take into account the existing considerable differences between geographic regions, depth zones and sediment types.},

	abstract = {This study examined spatial and temporal variations in infaunal community composition in a gradient away from a large salmon farm (producing 2910 tonnes during each production cycle) in Uggdalsfjorden, western Norway. The farm is located at a water depth of 230 m, is moored at a single point and moves with prevailing currents and winds. The study showed that the large-scale effects on the benthos were restricted to the nearest 250 m of the farm. This zone was dominated by the polychaetes Paramphinome jeffreysii, Prionospio steenstrupi, Capitella capitata and Heteromastus filiformis, the bivalves Thyasira sarsii and Abra nitida and the echinoderm Brissopsis lyrifera for the duration of the two-year study. Highest abundance and biomass were recorded at peak production at the farm, with 30 000 individuals m− 2 and 60 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m− 2. At this time abundance was 10 and biomass was 35 times higher within 250 m from the farm than 3 km away. Highest species richness was found 550–900 m from the farm, where, at peak production, the number of species doubled from 20 to 40 species per 0.1 m− 2. The study showed that at deep sites organic waste affects benthos on a spatial scale much larger than at shallow water sites, and although the infauna community composition varied over time, the consistency in the spatial pattern in the relationship between species richness, abundance and biomass in the course of the study indicates that the observed patterns were temporally stable. The loadings of organic matter from the farm did not exceed the capacity of the benthic community for decomposition, as indicated by the low and stable content of organic matter in the sediment around the farm.},

	abstract = {Both fisheries exploitation and increased nutrient loadings strongly affect fish and shellfish abundance and production in estuaries. These stressors do not act independently; instead, they jointly influence food webs, and each affects the sensitivity of species and ecosystems to the other. Nutrient enrichment and the habitat degradation it sometimes causes can affect sustainable yields of fisheries, and fisheries exploitation can affect the ability of estuarine systems to process nutrients. The total biomass of fisheries landings in estuaries and semi-enclosed seas tends to increase with nitrogen loadings in spite of hypoxia, but hypoxia and other negative effects of nutrient over-enrichment cause declines in individual species and in parts of systems most severely affected. More thoroughly integrated management of nutrients and fisheries will permit more effective management responses to systems affected by both stressors, including the application of fisheries regulations to rebuild stocks negatively affected by eutrophication. Reducing fishing mortality may lead to the recovery of depressed populations even when eutrophication contributes to population declines if actions are taken while the population retains sufficient reproductive potential. New advances in modeling, statistics, and technology promise to provide the information needed to improve the understanding and management of systems subject to both nutrient enrichment and fisheries exploitation.},

This assumption leads frequently to an “all or none” choice of either preserving coastal habitats or converting them to human use. However, our survey of wave attenuation data from field studies of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, nearshore coral reefs, and sand dunes reveals that these relationships are rarely linear. By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand, we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem-based management goals. This result suggests that reconciling competing demands on coastal habitats should not always result in stark preservation-versus-conversion choices.
Taking into account the nonlinear relation between preserved habitat area and wave attenuation facilitates integrated management of coastal conservation and development.

	abstract = {Mangroves are disappearing rapidly worldwide despite their well documented biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly “externalities.” Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove–water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32\% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US \$37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is {\textgreater}300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands.},

	abstract = {The spatial extent and timing of the impact of fish farms on the distribution and performance of a Posidonia oceanica meadow were examined in an embayment of the south-eastern coast of Spain (Hornillo Bay, Murcia). Changes in seagrass distribution were determined using available seagrass mapping (from 1988, i.e., before the onset of aquaculture activities and 1998) and by successive sampling in 1994 and 1998. Environmental variables (light attenuation coefficient, water-column dissolved nutrients and organic content of sediments) together with plant performance (shoot biomass, leaf growth rate, photosynthetic activity, carbohydrate reserves, the number of leaves per shoot, epiphyte loads and herbivore pressure) were measured in plants affected by organic discharges, and were compared with those found in reference healthy plants over an annual growth cycle. Since the onset of fish farm activity, 11.29 ha of P. oceanica meadow has been completely lost and 9.86 ha significantly degraded, thus resulting in a total affected area which accounts for about 53\% of the former meadow, or 7-fold the fish farming area. Unequal propagation of seagrass die-off or degradation reflects the relevance of local factors such as depth and hydrodynamism on the true extent of fish farm impact. Water transparency decreases and dissolved nutrient and organic content of sediments increases in the vicinity of cages compared to distant reference stations, thus supporting the notion of environmental gradients caused by the organic release from cages, which spreads outwards. Shoot size, leaf growth rate and the number of leaves per shoot in plants close to the fish farm decreased. Moreover, low leaf growth and low rhizome carbohydrate concentration (always relative to that found in an undisturbed area) indicated carbon budget imbalances. Since light reduction in the affected area was only modest (31\% of light reaching the sea surface, while at the same depth this figure was 39\% at the reference site), and light availability was well above the minimum requirement estimated for this species, neither this factor nor epiphyte overgrowth (epiphyte load was lower in the affected area) seem to explain such carbon imbalances or the observed meadow regression. Alternatively, the high herbivore pressure found in the affected zone suggests that overgrazing is one of the main causes of decreasing shoot sizes and hence of carbon imbalance, reduced growth and shoot mortality. The impact of fish farms on seagrasses, therefore, seems to be highly variable and depends on complex interactions between a large number of processes.},

Although individual impacts from coastal development, degraded water quality, and climate change have been documented, there has been no quantitative global assessment of seagrass loss until now. Our comprehensive global assessment of 215 studies found that seagrasses have been disappearing at a rate of 110 km2 yr−1 since 1980 and that 29\% of the known areal extent has disappeared since seagrass areas were initially recorded in 1879. Furthermore, rates of decline have accelerated from a median of 0.9\% yr−1 before 1940 to 7\% yr−1 since 1990.

	abstract = {The principal species of marine aquaculture in Europe are Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream (Sparus auratus). For Atlantic salmon and sea bass, a substantial part of total genetic variation is partitioned at the geographical population level. In the case of sea bream, gene flow across the Azores/Mediterranean scale appears to be extensive and population structuring is not detected. For Atlantic salmon and sea bass, natural population structure is at risk from genetic interaction with escaped aquaculture conspecifics. The locally adaptive features of populations are at risk from interbreeding with non-local aquaculture fish. Wild populations, generally, are at risk from interactions with aquaculture fish that have been subject to artificial selection or domestication. Atlantic salmon is the main European aquaculture species and its population genetics and ecology have been well-studied. A general case regarding genetic interactions can be based on the information available for salmon and extended to cover other species, in the appropriate context. A generalized flow chart for interactions is presented. Salmon escape from aquaculture at all life stages, and some survive to breed among wild salmon. Reproductive fitness in the escaped fish is lower than in native, wild fish because of behavioural deficiencies at spawning. However, as the number of salmon in aquaculture greatly exceeds the number of wild fish, even small fractional rates of escape may result in the local presence of large numbers, and high frequencies, of escaped fish. At present, policy and legislation in relation to minimizing genetic interactions between wild and aquaculture fish is best developed for Atlantic salmon, through the recommendations of the Oslo Agreement developed by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization and subsequent agreements on their implementation. In future, the potential use of genetically modified fish in aquaculture will make additional policy development necessary. Improved containment is recommended as the key to minimizing the numbers and therefore the effects of escaped fish. Emergency recovery procedures are recommended as a back-up measure in the case of containment failure. Reproductive sterility is recommended as a future key to eliminating the genetic potential of escaped fish. The maintenance of robust populations of wild fish is recommended as a key to minimizing the effects of escaped fish on wild populations.},

Nowadays, about 95\% of their production comes from aquaculture. In this study, we analyse if the rapid growth in the aquaculture production of both species has affected the capture fisheries prices of both species. In other words, we investigate if there is market integration between wild and farmed gilthead seabream and European seabass. In order to do this analysis, we use data from the main gilthead seabream and European seabass markets in Spain. The results show that there is no market integration between wild and farmed gilthead seabream and European seabass. This implies that capture fisheries are not affected by increases in the aquaculture production of both species. But gilthead seabream and European seabass aquaculture producers face a smaller demand that explains the difficulties this aquaculture segment is facing.},

This market is of interest, since it is the largest and most diversified salmon market in the world with wild and farmed species, from Europe and South and North America, competing in the same market. In contrast to the European Union (EU)- and U.S.-markets, there have been neither trade conflicts nor trade restrictions. The Japanese market can hence provide information about the impact of bringing substantial quantities of a new product into a market, and the effect of large-scale aquaculture on traditional fisheries. In this article, market integration between wild and farmed salmon on the Japanese market is examined, using both bivariate and multivariate cointegration analysis. Tests for the Law of One Price are also conducted. The results indicate that the species are close substitutes on the market, and that the expansion of farmed salmon has resulted in price decreases for all salmon species.},

	abstract = {The fishing industry plays an important role in the EU economy. Within the EU member states, Spain is the largest fish producer (catches and aquaculture) in terms of volume and also one of the major fish and fishing products consuming countries. However, despite the role of this food category in the Mediterranean diet, fish consumption might experience an important decrease in the future as a result of the changes in food habits observed over the last years. The main objective of the present paper was to investigate, by means of an exploratory study, the relative importance of different attributes on consumer perception of different factors (country of origin, obtaining method, storage conditions and purchasing price) in the decision making process when choosing sea fish in general. To achieve this goal the study was organized in two complementary steps: a qualitative approach (focus group discussions) aimed to identify which attributes and levels were considered the most relevant in the decision-making process when choosing sea fish; and a quantitative approach where conjoint analysis (CA) was applied to determine the utility values for the different levels of the selected attributes and the relative importance that these attributes have for sea fish purchasers. Among others, the most important factors for consumers when choosing sea fish were the country of origin (Spain–Morocco–Norway), the obtaining method (wild-farmed sea fish), the storage conditions (chilled-frozen) and the purchasing price (6–12–18 €/kg). In general, quantitative results showed that country of origin was the most important factor when choosing sea fish, although other related factors such as perceived fish freshness might be included. The three remaining attributes had a similar moderate importance, the autochthonous fresh wild sea fish sold at 6–12 €/kg being the preferred option. Only one segment of consumers (19.6\%) preferred farmed sea fish instead of wild sea fish. However the relative importance of the obtaining method attribute compared to the country of origin or the storage condition was very low. Based on these results, effective information strategies seem to be needed in order to support and increase farmed sea fish consumption, thus reducing the impact of unsustainable fishing practices and facing up to the overexploitation of the natural fish resources.},

The 3rd ISSESR, held in the U.S.A. in 2006 (www.SeaRanching.org), ushered the discipline into a new era. The major advances included: (1) definitions of the various objectives for releasing cultured juveniles (restocking, stock enhancement, and sea ranching); (2) a framework for integrating releases within their fisheries management context, including tools for quantitative assessment; (3) a systematic, transparent, and stakeholder-participatory planning process to determine whether releases have a cost-effective role to play in managing a fishery; (4) a comprehensive case study (blue crabs in Chesapeake Bay) describing the multi-disciplinary approach needed to evaluate the potential benefits of releases; and (5) a suite of other lessons to guide stakeholders in evaluating the potential for and implementation of releases.

We present a bioeconomic model of the interaction between a commercial wild fishery and capture-based aquaculture that depends on harvest of wild juveniles. We assume that aquaculture reduces the intrinsic growth rate of the wild fish stock due to wild caught juveniles used as seeds, influencing wild stock size and commercial harvest. This may increase the economic conflicts between fishers and farmers. Introducing a marine protected area is expected to reduce these conflicts. The model considers both open access and economically optimal management regimes outside the marine protected area using numerical simulation. The numerical results show that a marine protected area of a certain size may increase economic benefits of both fishers and farmers in the case of optimal management, and enhance wild catch outside the reserve when there is open access.},

In fishes, unprecedented reductions in abundance have been associated with unprecedented changes in harvesting and aquaculture technologies. Fishing, the predominant cause of fish-population collapses, is increasingly believed to generate evolutionary changes to characters of import to individual fitness, population persistence and levels of sustainable yield. Human-induced genetic change to wild populations can also result from interactions with their domesticated counterparts. Our examination of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution includes factors that may influence the magnitude, rate and reversibility of genetic responses, the potential for shifts in reaction norms and reduced plasticity, loss of genetic variability, outbreeding depression and their demographic consequences to wild fishes. We also suggest management initiatives to mitigate the effects of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution. Ultimately, the question of whether fishing or fish farming can cause evolutionary change is moot. The key issue is whether such change is likely to have negative conservation- or socio-economic consequences. Although the study of human-induced evolution on fishes should continue to include estimates of the magnitude and rate of selection, there is a critical need for research that addresses short- and long-term demographic consequences to population persistence, plasticity, recovery and productivity.},

In comparison, it is often difficult to accurately estimate disease impacts on wild populations, especially those of pelagic and subtidal species. Farmed species often receive infectious diseases from wild species and can, in turn, export infectious agents to wild species. However, the impact of disease export on wild fisheries is controversial because there are few quantitative data demonstrating that wild species near farms suffer more from infectious diseases than those in other areas.

	abstract = {The protistan parasite Haplosporidium nelsoni has caused extensive mortality in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States since 1957. The origin of H. nelsoni has remained unresolved. Molecular diagnostic tools were used to examine the hypothesis that a haplosporidian parasite in the Pacific oyster C. gigas is H. nelsoni. A DNA probe specific for H. nelsoni reacted positively in in situ hybridizations with haplosporidian plasmodia from C. gigas collected in Korea, Japan, and California. Primers that specifically amplify H. nelsoni DNA in the polymerase chain reaction amplified product from Californian C. gigas infected with the haplosporidian parasite. The DNA sequence of the 565-base pair amplified product was identical to the H. nelsoni sequence except for a single nucleotide transition, a similarity of 99.8\%. These results are conclusive evidence that the parasite in C. gigas is H. nelsoni and strongly support previous speculation that the parasite was introduced into Californian populations of C. gigas from Japan. Results also support previous speculation that H. nelsoni was introduced from the Pacific Ocean to C. virginica on the East Coast of the United States, likely with known importations of C. gigas. These results document greatly increased virulence in a naive host–parasite association and reinforce potential dangers of intentional, but improper, introductions of exotic marine organisms for aquaculture or resource restoration.},

	abstract = {Once a marine invader has become established, its subsequent control has rarely been attempted. We report the first apparently successful eradication of a locally well-established introduced marine pest. A previously unknown species of sabellid polychaete (now described as Terebrasabella heterouncinata arrived as an epizoic contaminant on South African abalone imported to California for commercial aquaculture research. In 1996, we detected an established sabellid population at an intertidal site near Cayucos, California (35 °45'N, 120 °95'W). To mitigate the impact of this introduced marine pest at this site, and prevent or slow its geographic spread, we proposed an eradication program based on the epidemiological theory of the threshold of transmission. Specifically, we removed 1.6 million of the most highly susceptible and preferred host in the intertidal area; the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis. A screen was also installed at the associated abalone mariculture facility to eliminate release of additional infested material (the source of the established sabellid population) and all such material was removed from the intertidal area. Using transect surveys and mark and recapture studies, we monitored the success of the eradication effort. Transmission of the pest can no longer be detected. Hence, the established sabellid population has apparently been eradicated. This discovery demonstrates that some alien marine pests can be eradicated and supports development of new proactive approaches to the management of other exotic marine pests.},

We examine market interactions in the French fresh sea bass and sea bream markets. We test for long-term price parity between farmed and wild products for these two species, applying a bivariate cointegration approach to market delineation. We also conduct the Law of One Price (LOP) test between price series. Our data base consists of monthly domestic price series for fish purchased by French households from 2007 to 2012. Our empirical results show that the fresh fish markets for whole wild and farmed sea bream are partially integrated, yet those for whole wild and farmed sea bass are not integrated. The substantially higher price for wild sea bass relative to farmed sea bass suggests that consumers may be more sensitive to seafood production processes when it comes to higher-value species.},

	abstract = {Artificial propagation programs focused on production, such as commercial aquaculture or forestry, entail strong domestication selection. Spillover from such programs can cause unintended fitness and demographic consequences for wild conspecifics. The range of possible management practices to minimize such consequences vary in their control of genetic and demographic processes. Here, we use a model of coupled genetic and demographic dynamics to evaluate alternative management approaches to minimizing unintended consequences of aquaculture escapees. We find that, if strong natural selection occurs between escape and reproduction, an extremely maladapted (i.e., nonlocal-origin, highly domesticated) stock could have fitness consequences analogous to a weakly diverged cultured stock; otherwise, wild population fitness declines with increasing maladaptation in the cultured stock. Reducing escapees through low-level leakage is more effective than reducing an analogous number of escapees from large, rare pulses. This result arises because low-level leakage leads to the continual lowering of wild population fitness and subsequent increased proportional contribution of maladapted cultured escapees to the total population. Increased sterilization efficacy can cause rapid, nonlinear reductions in unintended fitness consequences. Finally, sensitivity to the stage of escape indicates a need for improved monitoring data on how the number of escapees varies across life cycle stages. © 2013 The Authors.

Although little is known about how this affects the local fishery, two hypotheses have been put forward; a trapping and a protecting effect on wild fish. This study provides the first monitoring of commercial and recreational fishing activity at a fish farm. We assessed the effect on the small-scale fishery analysing the differences between fishing in farm proximity and away from the farm (in terms of catch rate, income and catch composition). Moreover, we estimated the biomass removal from fishing activities by farm employees inside the farm. The study was conducted from January 2011 to June 2012 at a Gilthead seabream farm in the NW Mediterranean. The findings revealed a relevant amount of commercial and recreational fishing effort in farm proximity. Yet, the results showed no benefit or difference of fishing in close proximity to the farm compared with areas away from the farm. Thus, we conclude that farm-aggregated fish are protected from the commercial fleet by the farm leasehold area, but remain vulnerable to hidden fishing practices inside the farm, where farm employees harvest more than 4 t of wild fish annually.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Coastal aquaculture is a globally expanding enterprise. Currently, 1200 salmon farms operate in coastal Norway, yet their capacity to aggregate and subsequently modify wild fish distributions is poorly known. Aggregations of wild fish at 9 farms and 9 control locations were counted on 3 separate days in June to August 2007. On each sampling occasion, 6 counts were made at 5 distinct depth-strata at each farm and control location. Wild fish were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more abundant at farms than at control sites, depending on the location. Gadoid fish (Pollachius virens, Gadus morhua and Melanogrammus aeglefinus) dominated farm-associated assemblages and were present across a wide range of sizes, from juveniles to large adults. Estimated total farm-aggregated wild fish biomass averaged 10.2 metric tonnes (t) per farm across the 9 farms (range: 600 kg to 41.6 t). Applied across the geographical range of Norway’s 1200 salmon farms, our estimates indicate that salmon farms attract and aggregate over 12 000 t of wild fish into a total of just 750 ha of coastal waters on any given day in summer. Possible consequences of these persistent, substantial aggregations of wild fishes at farms include a heightened potential for the transfer of pathogens from salmon farms to wild fish and among adjacent salmon farms, and altered availability of wild fish to fisheries. Restrictions on fishing in the immediate surrounds of salmon farms may avoid farms acting as ecological traps, particularly for species with depressed populations such as G. morhua, which are highly attracted to farms.},

For the aquaculture sector to maintain its current average growth rate of 8 to 10 percent per year to 2025, the supply of nutrient and feed inputs will have to grow at a similar rate. This had been readily attainable when the industry was young. It may not be the case anymore as the sector has grown into a major consumer of and competitor for feed resources. This paper reviews the dietary feeding practices employed for the production of the major cultured fed species, the total global production and market availability of the major feed ingredient sources used and the major constraints to feed ingredient usage, and recommends approaches to feed ingredient selection and usage for the major species of cultivated fish and crustacean. Emphasis is placed on the need for major producing countries to maximize the use of locally available feed-grade ingredient sources, and, in particular, to select and use those nutritionally sound and safe feed ingredient sources whose production and growth can keep pace with the 8 to 10 percent annual average annual growth of the fed finfish and crustacean aquaculture sector},

The increasing economic dimension of Mediterranean aquaculture is opening new economic niches and may be a valid support to reduce the pressure of traditional fisheries. Aquaculture practices can also lead to modifications of coastal habitats through the impact of wastes of land-based and open-sea mariculture facilities. In addition to these aspects which place a direct pressure on aquatic ecosystems and wild fishery resources, a wide range of environmental contaminants, such as chemicals used in farming operations, can accumulate in farmed organisms and put fish health and quality at risk. Thus, as aquaculture makes its transition to a major food-producing sector, proper assessment and control of environmental impacts and food safety awareness are becoming increasingly important. The development of simple tools able to monitor the extent of environmental and biological impacts associated with farming operations at various levels of biological complexity from the ecosystem to the organism level is required. Although a number of techniques for assessing the environmental and biological impact of pollutants in natural ecosystems are available, the development of practical and validated tools is sorely needed in aquaculture.},

Aquaculture is also practised for the improvement of natural stocks through artificial recruitment and transplantation or for the production of bait, sport, or ornamental fish. The different types of aquaculture include culture of fish and shrimps in ponds, tanks, cages, enclosures, raceways, and recirculating systems, and "bottom" and "hanging" methods of mollusc culture.World production through aquaculture (excluding bait, sport, and ornamental fish and production through stocking of open waters) is over 5 million tons. This has an important role in the food and nutrition of many countries and is particularly significant in integrated rural development.Aquaculture can contribute significant..., Dans le passé l’aquiculture a pris diverses formes, mais à l’heure actuelle l’intérêt s’oriente surtout vers la création d’industries viables.

Here, I review how the biology and ecology of various louse and host species influence their pathogenicity and epidemiology. Recent discoveries of new species and genotypes emphasize the need for more basic research on louse taxonomy and host preferences. Louse development rates are strongly dependent on temperature, and increasing mean sea temperatures are likely to increase infestation pressure on farms and wild fish, as well as affecting the geographical distribution of hosts and parasites. Despite progress in finding L. salmonis larvae in the plankton and in modelling louse production in several countries, more data on larval behaviour and distribution are required to develop dispersal and transmission models for both L. salmonis and Caligus spp. This knowledge could be used to take measures to reduce the risks of lice affecting farmed and wild fish.},

	abstract = {Norway has the largest salmon-farming industry in the world, an industry that is still growing, and in recent years production of marine species like Atlantic cod has also increased. At the same time, Norway has the world's largest wild stock of Atlantic salmon and has fjord systems and ocean areas rich in wild marine fish species which form the basis of a large fishing industry. As the aquaculture industry grows and diversifies, there is concern about the potential effects of pathogens spreading from farmed fish to wild populations. The overall health situation in Norwegian aquaculture is good, but some pathogens are not controlled effectively. In particular, salmon lice produced in farms may cause problems for wild salmonids and other parasites may be abundant too. Also, viral diseases in Atlantic salmon and bacterial diseases in Atlantic cod give rise to several disease outbreaks annually. The open design of most aquaculture systems allows the transmission of pathogens from the environment or from wild fish to the farmed fish. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge of disease interaction and pathogen exchange between farmed and wild fish populations, with emphasis on Norwegian condition. In addition, the paper contains an evaluation of research methods that would be useful in expanding knowledge of pathogen exchange between wild and farmed fish, and in surveys of diseases in wild fish populations. The impact of pathogen transfer from farmed fish to economically important wild fish populations is assessed together with risk analysis considering possible consequences of pathogen exchange between farmed and wild fish. Finally, the review contains suggestions for future research that will increase the knowledge in the field.},

	abstract = {Coastal aquaculture installations concentrate large numbers of wild fish species of both ecological and economic importance, including schools of bogue, Boops boops (L.), in high abundance and biomass. The aggregated species consume large quantities of the easily available pellets lost from cages. As a consequence, the physical condition of farm-associated wild fish is increased and their physiology is altered. These changes may influence local fisheries as many of these aggregating species are targeted by fishers. We assess whether local fishers catch wild fish that have previously aggregated at fish farms by comparing the body condition, trophic indexes, diet overlap and the fatty acid (FA) composition of B. boops obtained from local fish markets and around fish farms. Bogue captured by trammel-nets and around fish farms facilities presented a similar biological condition, as well as high quantities of pellets in the gut, and their FA profile was affected by vegetal-derived FAs. In contrast, bogue captured by trawlers were not influenced by fish farms, as they consumed natural trophic resources. We conclude that artisanal fishers exploit these aggregated fish populations once they have dispersed away from farms, and benefit from a ‘biomass export’ from fish farms at a local scale.},

	abstract = {The environmental impact of marine fish-farming depends very much on species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, hydrography of the site and husbandry practices. In general, some 85\% of phosphorus, 80–88\% of carbon and 52–95\% of nitrogen input into a marine fish culture system as feed may be lost into the environment through feed wastage, fish excretion, faeces production and respiration. Cleaning of fouled cages may also add an organic loading to the water, albeit periodically. Problems caused by high organic and nutrient loadings conflict with other uses of the coastal zone. The use of chemicals (therapeutants, vitamins and antifoulants) and the introduction of pathogens and new genetic strains have also raised environmental concerns. Despite the high pollution loadings, results from various studies show that some 23\% of C, 21\% of N and 53\% of P of feed input into the culture system is being accumulated in the bottom sediments and the significant impact is normally confined to within 1 km of the farm. The major impact is on the sea bottom, where high sediment oxygen demand, anoxic sediments, production of toxic gases and a decrease in benthic diversity may result. Decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in nutrient levels in the water are also evident but are normally confined to the vicinity of the farm. Tributyltin (TBT) contamination and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been reported near fish farms. The stimulating effects of vitamins/fish wastes on growth of red tide species have been demonstrated in a number of laboratory studies. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the present use of therapeutants, vitamins and antibiotics and the introduction of pathogens and new genetic strains would pose a significant threat to the environment. Marine fish culture can be a sustainable development, provided pollution loadings generated by fish farms are kept well below the carrying capacity of the water body. Effects can be significantly reduced by careful site selection, control of stock density, improved feed formulation and integrated culture (with macroalgae, filter-feeders and deposit-feeders). An example of the application of computer modelling in mariculture management is demonstrated. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring should also be carried out to ensure culture activities are environmentally sustainable.},

	abstract = {Since Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) used for farming are usually genetically different from local wild populations, breeding of escaped farmed salmon potentially results in genetic changes in wild populations. To determine the likelihood and impact of such genetic change, an experiment was undertaken, in a natural spawning tributary of the Burrishoole system in western Ireland, to compare the performance of wild, farmed, and hybrid Atlantic salmon progeny. Juveniles were assigned to family and group parentage by DNA profiling based on composite genotypes at seven minisatellite loci. Survival of the progeny of farmed salmon to the smolt stage was significantly lower than that of wild salmon, with increased mortality being greatest in the period from the eyed egg to the first summer. However, progeny of farmed salmon grew fastest and competitively displaced the smaller native fish downstream. The offspring of farmed salmon showed a reduced incidence of male parr maturity compared with native fish. The latter also showed a greater tendency to migrate as autumn pre-smolts. Growth and performance of hybrids were generally either intermediate or not significantly different from the wild fish. The demonstration that farmed and hybrid progeny can survive in the wild to the smolt stage, taken together with unpublished data that show that these smolts can survive at sea and home to their river of origin, indicates that escaped farmed salmon can produce long-term genetic changes in natural populations. These changes affect both single-locus and high-heritability quantitative traits, e.g. growth, sea age of maturity. While some of these changes may be advantageous from an angling management perspective, they are likely, in specific circumstances, to reduce population fitness and productivity. Full assessment of these changes will require details of marine survival, homing and reproductive performance of the adults together with information on the F2 generation.},

	abstract = {Escapes of farmed fish from aquaculture installations, as well as large scale stock enhancement and sea ranching activities, are regarded as risk factors for negative genetic impacts on native gene pools. These aspects have been discussed for several decades, and a number of recent experiments on Atlantic salmon have clearly demonstrated dramatically reduced overall fitness of farmed offspring compared with offspring of wild origin. The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) is now the most promising new marine species for large scale farming in Norway, and more than 500 commercial farming licenses have been issued, corresponding to a maximum annual production capacity of about 300,000 tonnes. In comparison with the environmental problems caused by escapes from the salmon farming industry, cod farming presents new challenges. As a marine species, cod are able to spawn in the net pens during the ongrowing period and thus release genetic material into the environment. Coastal cod stocks in Norwegian waters are depleted and therefore may be particularly vulnerable to genetic interaction with farmed cod. Thus, there is an urgent need for more detailed knowledge of potential hazards. A pilot experiment performed in Heimarkspollen in Austevoll (a practically landlocked fjord) demonstrated for the first time that farmed cod are capable of producing viable cod larvae that mix with larvae from wild cod. The farmed cod used in the pilot experiment were homozygotic for a rare allele (GPI-1*30), and mature fish were placed in a net pen to allow spawning and egg drift into the surrounding water to take place. Surveys of eggs found the highest densities in the vicinity of the net pen. Later larval surveys found that 20\% to 25\% of the larvae sampled in the area possessed the unique genetic marker and could therefore be traced to the spawning cod in the net cage. Numerous genetically marked larvae were also found outside Heimarkspollen, indicating a high degree of dispersal of eggs and larvae by tidal advection.},

However, his theory is subject to significant limitations. While this is less so within his model, it is particularly so in an extended one outlined here. These other models allow for the possibility that aquaculture development can impact negatively on wild stocks thereby shifting the supply curve of the capture fishery, or raise the demand for the fish species subject both to aquaculture and capture. Such development can threaten wild fish stocks and their biodiversity. While aquaculture development could in principle have no impact on the biodiversity of wild stocks or even raise aquatic biodiversity overall, its impact in the long‐term probably will be one of reducing aquatic diversity both in the wild and overall. The development of aquaculture does not automatically ensure long‐term sustainability of fish and other aquatic supplies.},

The results show that prices of cultivated species are higher than prices of the same species when harvested from the sea. We explain this fact by the interplay of three forces. First, the amount of wild fish to feed aquaculture species continues to improve over time. Second, the pressure of fishing activities has not been reduced since catches of most forage fishes are declining, which induce higher prices of capture species that feed aquaculture production. Third, the level of seafood market concentration is significantly higher in aquaculture than in wild catches, which generates higher prices in aquaculture.},

	abstract = {For two decades significant expansion in the volume of intensively farmed fish has occurred accompanied by substantial price reductions. This more competitive aquaculture sector has generated concerns over the impact on the market for fish. Market interactions for three groups of farmed fish species ‐ salmon, catfish and sea bass/sea bream are reviewed. Evidence suggests there is little substitution between farmed and cultured product, apart from species available both farmed and wild. Nonetheless the expansion of aquaculture supplies asserts growth in the market and the capture of market share from some other products. Existing data deficiencies may preclude identification of these changes and more detailed data especially from further along the value chain are required. Furthermore, the various unique attributes differentiating farmed product from captured may also explain the lack of integration. It is concluded that a combination of more refined price and non‐price data will be critical to future research.},

	abstract = {The remarkable growth of the global salmon aquaculture industry has generated important implications for Alaskan salmon fisheries as increased supplies of farmed product have led to declines in prices of both farmed and wild species. In the particular case of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, falling prices and declining profit margins have led to reduced participation in the limited-entry fishery. This study conducts a formal examination of market interactions between the aquaculture and commercial fishery sectors by adapting the Homans and Wilen (1997) model of regulated open access to the context of restricted access fisheries. The econometric model reveals that limited entry regulations were initially successful in extracting rents from the Bristol Bay fishery; however, these rents were gradually dissipated as a result of overcapacity and the effect of falling ex-vessel prices. The emergence of aquaculture provides a strong rationale in favor of right-based approaches to fisheries management in Alaska.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of vertical rhizome growth as an early indicator of fish farm impacts to Posidonia oceanica meadows was tested by comparing annual estimates of vertical rhizome growth, quantified retrospectively, at distances ranging between 5 and 1200m from fish cages at four Mediterranean locations (Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain). The studied fish farms had been operating since, at least, 1997, producing between 150 and 1150tonsyr−1 of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax), and, at Italy, also sharpsnout sea bream (Diplodus puntazzo). The reconstructed vertical rhizome growth spanned from 19 to 25 years of growth, depending on sites, and the average vertical rhizome growth before the onset of fish farm operations ranged between 4.48 and 8.79mmyr−1. The vertical rhizome growth after the onset of farming activities declined significantly (t-test, P{\textless}0.05) from the control station (at {\textgreater}800m from the farm; vertical growth rate averaged 6.79, 5.52, 3.89 and 3.70mmyr−1 at Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain control stations, respectively) to the impacted one (at 5–300m from the farm; vertical growth rate was 4.82, 3.52, 2.77 and 1.92mmyr−1 at Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain impacted stations, respectively) at each farm. Moreover, vertical growth significantly (t-test, P{\textless}0.05) declined by about twofold following the onset of fish farm operations for the extant meadow nearest to the cages, as well as those supporting intermediate impacts at distances 35–400m from the cages. Vertical rhizome growth was not significantly affected after the onset of fish farm operations for the meadows located more than 800m from the farm, except in those from the Italian site, the largest farm. Examination of the time course of vertical growth for individual rhizomes in the areas of the meadow nearest to the farms, except for those at Cyprus, showed that the decline in vertical growth was initiated within the year of the onset of farming activities, suggesting a negligible resistance of seagrass meadows to fish farm impacts. The results obtained confirm that fish farm activities strongly affect seagrass health on the surrounding meadows, and clearly demonstrate the value of reductions in vertical rhizome growth as an early warning symptom of stress and impacts to P. oceanica meadows.},

	abstract = {In the South China and Java Seas, cage farming is a recent regional activity, which since the year 2000 has experienced an annual growth of 29\%. The region holds the highest diversity of marine life, which is partly or completely dependent on coral reefs. The increasingly growing coastal human population in the area relies on ecosystem goods and services provided by the reefs that are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Sea cage farming is one of the stressors negatively impacting coral reefs by being point sources of nutrients and other effluents. To date no systematic information is available on the physical location of marine farms in relation to the coral reefs. Little is known about the distance where impact from the farms can be detected on nearby coral reefs. The present survey aimed to fill this gap by assessing to what extent marine cage farms in South East Asia are placed in the vicinity of the reefs and at which distance stress indicators from the farms are observed. We used Google Earth satellite images to investigate the extension and spatial distribution of sea cage aquaculture in relation to the presence of coral reefs. The stress indicators were locally assessed in Central Vietnam by recording turf algal overgrowth, coral mortality, live coral and branching coral cover at increasing distances from the farms. We found that 90\% of sea cage farms throughout the region clustered closer than 5km from coral reefs and 50\% of them closer than 1km from reefs. In Taiwan, 71\% of the cages were located within 100m from a reef. This pattern is nonrandom and could not be explained by the natural distribution of coral reefs; only 5\% of the Vietnamese coast harbors coral reefs, and sea cage farms are present in these areas only. This indicates that the farms require similar conditions as the reefs including clear and shallow waters and protection against storms and wave action. We found that turf algal overgrowth decreased at 287m±54m, dead coral at 1446m±154m, live coral cover increased at 566±221m and branching corals increased at 867m±140m from the cage farms. We conclude that proximity to coral reefs should be considered when planning future developments of sea cage aquaculture, and recommend that distances of at least 1.5km should be kept. Consider coral reefs when planning sea cage aquaculture site.},

The responses of each of these groups are evaluated separately against the four main water quality parameters: (1) increased dissolved inorganic nutrients, (2) enrichment with particulate organic matter, (3) light reduction from turbidity and (4) increased sedimentation. This separation facilitates disentangling and understanding the mechanisms leading to changes in the field, where many contaminants and many responses co-occur. The review also summarises geographic and biological factors that determine local and regional levels of resistance and resilience to degradation. It provides a conceptual aid to assess the kind of change(s) likely to occur in response to changing coastal water quality.},

	abstract = {Recent studies report conflicting results concerning the effects of eutrophication on coral reproduction. The present study examines reproductive effort in the brooding coral Stylophora pistillata exposed to chronic eutrophication caused by in situ fish cages (FC) in the northern Gulf of Eilat (Aqaba). Histological studies of 20 S. pistillata colonies transplanted to each of two study sites, one close to the nutrient enriched FC site and the other at a reference site (IUI), 8 km southwest of the FC site, show that, overall, corals from the FC site have a significantly higher percentage of polyps containing oocytes and testes than corals from the IUI site. However, average oocyte size and the percentage of oocytes reaching the size at which fertilization occurs (i.e., {\textgreater}200 μm) were both significantly greater in colonies at the IUI site compared to the FC site. As the reproductive season progressed, colonies at the IUI site exhibited a decrease in the percentage of polyps containing oocytes, concomitant with an increase in the number of polyps containing planulae, indicating successful development of oocytes into planulae. In contrast, in colonies at the FC site oocyte numbers were greatest at the end of the reproductive season, and overall, numbers of planulae were significantly lower compared with the IUI colonies, suggesting relative failure of oocyte maturation, fertilization and ensuing larval development. The significantly higher lipid content found during the reproduction season in IUI colonies compared with FC colonies corroborates this assertion. This data strongly suggest that nutrients released from the fish farms have adverse effects on successful production of larvae of S. pistillata. In view of the recent severe deterioration of the coral reefs of Eilat and their present critical state of health, the only chance for their renewal is the use of immediate, prudent and rational protection measures against all man-made perturbations.},

Improved fisheries governance is now slowly stabilizing many stocks and recently bluefin aquaculture has emerged as an economic alternative route for supplying the market. Most of captured bluefin tuna directly enters the global seafood market, but an increasing part of catches are destined to aquaculture (17–37\%) as bluefin aquaculture almost exclusively depends on wild specimens for stocking. Farming is mainly being performed in the Mediterranean region, Mexico, Australia, and Japan. Few studies have focused on the global importance and future role of bluefin aquaculture and there are confounding uncertainties related to production volumes and trends. This study provides an overview of global bluefin tuna aquaculture and identifies its direct and indirect interactions with wild fish stocks, outlines some of the challenges for future expansion as well as pointing out significant mismatch of production statistics.},

	abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

However, whereas the proportion of non-food landings destined for reduction has been relatively constant since 1970 (mean ± SD: 23.17 ± 3.74 million tonnes), “other” non-food use landings have risen markedly from 0.90 million tonnes in 1970 (3.7\% total non-food use landings) to 13.14 million tonnes in 2006 or 39.5\% total non-food use landings. At present, small pelagic forage fish species, including “low-value/trash fish,” form the bulk of the fisheries catch destined for non-food uses, with the aquaculture sector currently being the largest consumer. In 2006, it is estimated that the aquaculture sector consumed an estimated 23.8 million tonnes of small pelagic forage fish in the form of feed inputs, including 3.72 million tonnes used to make fish meal, 0.83 million tonnes to make fish oil used in compounded aquafeeds, and an additional 7.2 million tonnes of low value/trash fish as a direct feed or within farm-made aquafeeds.},

	abstract = {Within international markets for fish, the past decade has witnessed a significant growth and proliferation of products labelled to be sustainable or responsibly sourced. These terms encapsulate a range of criteria concerning the state of the stocks and, inter alia, how the fish have been captured. Of the different modes of capture ‘line-caught’ is one of the longer standing and with associations to lesser impacts upon the environment. Yet despite this position, there appears to have been little assessment of any price premiums realised for fish marketed with environmental, responsibly-sourced, line-caught or other such credentials. This paper is the first published study to examine whether such attributes of chilled fish products command any price premium at the supermarket level of the value chain. The study is based on 68 weekly observations of chilled pre-packed cod and haddock in seven different supermarkets in the UK. The study also examines possible price premiums for other observable attributes such as product form, processing and country of origin, in addition to any differences in pricing between the supermarkets. The results show that the ‘line-caught’ attribute gives cod and haddock a price premium of 18\% and 10\%, respectively. The MSC ecolabel gives a 10\% price premium on haddock products.},

The regulatory framework is changed from an input regulation based on farm-specific feed quotas, to an individual transferable quota system on nitrogen pollution. The regulatory change is analyzed using Data Envelopment Analysis to model the underlying production structure. The effect of allowing trading of nitrogen quotas on production and profitability is analyzed in a joint production model with good and bad output under different behavioral and technical assumptions, whilst keeping the overall pollution level of nitrogen constant. Furthermore, the effect of a catchment area restriction on nitrogen is analyzed to comply with the EU Water Framework Directive. The paper quantifies the gains of a policy change from a command and control system to an incentive based system. The estimated results suggest that the changed regulation could increase Danish aquaculture production by 16 to 55\%, whilst actual profitability could be increased 5 to 10 times.},

	abstract = {Time/area closures have been widely used in fisheries management to prevent overfishing and the destruction of marine biodiversity. To a lesser degree, such spatio-temporal management measures have been used to reduce by-catch of finfish or protected species. However, as ecosystem-based management approaches are employed and more fisheries are managed through multispecies, multiobjective models, the management of by-catch will likely become increasingly important. The elimination of by-catch has become a primary goal of the fishing policies of many countries. It is particularly relevant in the United States, as the deadline for setting annual catch limits (ACLs) in all fisheries passes in 2011. This will result in a dramatic expansion of the number of catch and by-catch quotas. Such catch measures may result in the early closure of otherwise sustainable fisheries when by-catch quotas are exceeded. To prevent such closures and the consequent economic hardship to fishers and the economy, it is imperative that managers be given the tools necessary to reduce by-catch and improve fishing selectivity. Targeted spatio-temporal fishery closures are one solution open to managers. Here, we examine how the spatio-temporal and oceanographic characteristics of by-catch may be used by managers to design fishery closures, and place these methods within a decision tree to assist managers to identify appropriate management measures. We argue that the current movement towards marine spatial planning (MSP) presents an important impetus to examine how we manage fisheries spatially, and we offer a first step towards the objective participation of fisheries in the MSP process.},

	abstract = {Salmon production is an important industry in Scotland, with an estimated retail value {\textgreater}£1 billion. However, this salmon industry can be threatened by the invasion and spread of diseases. To reduce this risk, the industry is divided into management areas that are physically separated from each other. Pathogens can spread between farms by local processes such as water movement or by long-distance processes such as live fish movements. Here, network modelling was used to investigate the importance of transmission routes at these two scales. We used different disease transmission rates (β), where infected farms had the probability of 0.10, 0.25 or 0.50 per month to infect each contacted farm. Interacting farms were modelled in such a way that neighbours within a management area could infect each other, resulting in two contacts per farm per month. In addition, non-local transmission occurred at random. Salmon are input to marine sites where they are raised to harvest size, the site is then fallowed; in the model the effects of different fallowing strategies (synchronised, partial synchronised and unsynchronised fallowing at the management area level) on the emergence of diseases were investigated. Synchronised fallowing was highly effective at eradicating epidemics when transmission rate is low (β=0.10) even when long distance contacts were fairly common (up to 1.5farm−1month−1). However for higher transmission rates, long distance contacts have to be kept at much lower levels (0.15contactsmonth−1 where β=0.25) when synchronised fallowing was applied. If fallowing was partially synchronised or unsynchronised then low rates of long-distance contact are required (0.75 or 0.15farm−1month−1) even if β=0.10. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of having epidemiologically isolated management areas and applying synchronised fallowing.},

Catch trends within the bay were compared to regional trends. Results of correlation analyses indicated that ovigerous catch trends were strongly affected by the fish farm’s feeding/fallow periods. There was no significant correlation between trends for bay and LFA lobster landings. Patterns of lobster catch per unit effort extending over considerable distance in Port Mouton Bay appear to be influenced by proximity to the fish farm regardless of year-to-year variation in water temperatures and weather conditions.

After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the 'tragedy of the commons' argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

Through experimental crosses, we demonstrate transmission of a growth hormone transgene via hybridization between a candidate for commercial aquaculture production, GM Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and closely related wild brown trout (Salmo trutta). Transgenic hybrids were viable and grew more rapidly than transgenic salmon and other non-transgenic crosses in hatchery-like conditions. In stream mesocosms designed to more closely emulate natural conditions, transgenic hybrids appeared to express competitive dominance and suppressed the growth of transgenic and non-transgenic (wild-type) salmon by 82 and 54 per cent, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of environmental impacts of hybridization between a GM animal and a closely related species. These results provide empirical evidence of the first steps towards introgression of foreign transgenes into the genomes of new species and contribute to the growing evidence that transgenic animals have complex and context-specific interactions with wild populations. We suggest that interspecific hybridization be explicitly considered when assessing the environmental consequences should transgenic animals escape to nature.},

Little ecological risk is anticipated from engineered strains kept in fully contained facilities, so the concern is largely directed toward the reliability of containment measures and determining whether robust ecological data, pertinent to nature, can be generated within research facilities to minimize uncertainty and allow reliable risk-assessment predictions.

This is partly because of the difficulties in reliably predicting the ecological risk of transgenic fish should they escape into the wild. The ecological consequences of the phenotypic differences between transgenic and wild-type fish, as determined in the laboratory, can be uncertain because of genotype-by-environment effects (GXE). Additionally, we are limited in our ability to extrapolate simple phenotypes to the complex ecological interactions that occur in nature. Genetic background can also shape the phenotypic effects of transgenes, which, over time and among different wild populations, can make risk assessments a continuously evolving target. These uncertainties suggest that assessments of transgenic fish in contained facilities need to be conducted under as wide a range of conditions as possible, and that efficacious physical and biological containment strategies remain as crucial approaches to ensure the safe application of transgenic fish technology.},

However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015\% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives. Marine aquaculture has the potential to improve food security. A global analysis shows that space in coastal areas is unlikely to limit the potential for aquaculture.},

We review existing examples of marine aquaculture spatial development worldwide and discuss the proper use of site selection in relation to different legal and regulatory requirements.

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers.},

	abstract = {Community ecology theory can be used to understand biological invasions by applying recent niche concepts to alien species and the communities that they invade. These ideas lead to the concept of ‘niche opportunity’, which defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space. Niche opportunities vary naturally between communities but might be greatly increased by disruption of communities, especially if the original community members are less well adapted to the new conditions. Recent niche theory clarifies the prediction that low niche opportunities (invasion resistance) result from high species diversity. Conflicting empirical patterns of invasion resistance are potentially explained by covarying external factors. These various ideas derived from community ecology provide a predictive framework for invasion ecology.},

	abstract = {Non-indigenous species (NIS) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. Most of these NIS invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. Although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast  water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for NIS transfer today, andmany recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. The rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. Estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of NIS per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. We now know of approximately 400 NIS along the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S., and hundreds of marine and estuarine NIS are reported from other regions of the world. Although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of NIS invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of NIS among sites. Mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of NIS, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities,but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. Although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that NIS are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. Taxonomically diverse NIS are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. The impacts of most NIS remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. Nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of NIS invasions and scope of then effects, studies of marine communities that do not include NIS are increasingly incomplete},

To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.},

	doi = {10.1086/mre.22.4.42629566},
	abstract = {ITQ regulation relies on a decentralized market mechanism and a single price to allocate access to a stock of fish. The resulting allocation will not be fully efficient if the stock being allocated is heterogeneous or if there are potential gains from centralized coordination of harvesting effort. If stocks are heterogeneous in their density, location, or unit value during the season, harvesters governed by an ITQ policy will not be indifferent to when or where they exercise their quotas. Stocks that are relatively dense and/or close to port will be preferred to those less dense or more remote. Because an ITQ policy assigns the same opportunity cost of each unit harvested, individual harvesters have an incentive to compete for higher valued units and such competition may dissipate part of the fishery's potential rent. A similar phenomenon arises when stock densities vary in an unknown way over space or time, so harvesters must engage in costly search. Individual harvesters governed by an ITQ policy have no incentive to share information on stock locations, which can lead to redundant search effort. We demonstrate that both sources of inefficiency can be eliminated either by defining ITQ rights more precisely or by an agreement among harvesters to coordinate their effort. We develop models that illustrate these effects and identify the factors that determine their likely size. Anecdotal evidence on practices adopted by fishery cooperatives is presented to illustrate the practical relevance of the issues we raise.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is increasingly interacting with fisheries from a socio-economic perspective at the level of the global food market. In addition, since 36\% of landings from fisheries are used for the production of fishmeal and fish oil, which are essential feed elements for many aquaculture species, another source of interaction is at the level of the aqua feed market. The relevance of the interactions between the two sectors is becoming more evident as the process of transition from fishing to farming has reached a pivotal point, with almost 50\% of the fish food supply now coming from aquaculture. The analyses on aquaculture and fisheries interactions often result in diverging views. This paper reviews the main positions in the recent scientific literature, structuring the discussion along the following themes: food market interactions; comparison of resources use by means of Life Cycle Assessment; use of fishmeal and fish oil and aqua feed markets; impacts on small pelagic fish stocks; food security; technical substitution of fishmeal and fish oil with alternative ingredients. The review is not aimed at taking a definitive position in respect of these complex issues but rather at summarising the different scientific contributions and indicating possible areas for further research. Research on fisheries and aquaculture interactions is considered beneficial in terms of policy support especially now that the reform of European Common Fishery Policy is assigning greater relevance to the growth of aquaculture and to its role in terms of socio-economic development for coastal and rural communities. In a more global perspective, the understanding of interactions between aquaculture and fisheries is important to evaluate the respective contributions to food security goals and the implications in terms of environmental sustainability and resource use efficiency.},

A shift towards a more comprehensive management of these activities, as with recent emphasis on ecosystem-based approaches to management, requires a means for evaluating their interactive and cumulative impacts. Here we develop a framework for this evaluation, focusing on five core concepts: (1) activities have interactive and cumulative impacts, (2) management decisions require consideration of, and tradeoffs among, all ecosystem services, (3) not all stressors are equal or have impacts that increase linearly, (4) management must account for the different scales of activities and impacts, and (5) some externalities cannot be controlled locally but must be accounted for in marine spatial planning. Comprehensive ocean zoning provides a powerful tool with which these key concepts are collectively addressed.},

In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances. (1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. GIS may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.},

Fisheries are in open access, while the aquaculture sector is competitive. We show that when biological interactions are moderate, the introduction of aquaculture is beneficial in the long run: it improves consumer utility and alleviates the pressure on the edible fish stock. Results are deeply modified when biological interactions are strong: the stock of edible wild fish is reduced and the introduction of aquaculture may even cause a decrease in consumer utility. We then explore the consequences of improving aquaculture efficiency and the sensitivity of consumer preferences to the farmed fish characteristics, in the case where biological interactions are absent. Lastly, we analyze how our outcomes on the entry of aquaculture are affected when the wild edible fishery is optimally regulated, in combination with different assumptions on the regulation of the feed fishery. Results are again conditional on the intensity of biological interactions.},

Meantime, to illuminate the potential effects caused by the river discharge and aquaculture activities, wastewater from three breeding plants and surface water from six rivers flowing into the Bohai Bay were also analyzed for the selected antibiotics. The result revealed that measured antibiotics in the North Bobai Bay were generally higher than those in the South, highlighting the remarkable effects of high density of human activities on the exposure of antibiotics in environment. The antibiotics found in the six rivers were generally higher than those in the Bohai Bay reflecting the important antibiotics source of river discharge. This study reveals that the high consumption of some antibiotics in aquaculture activities may pose high ecological risk to the bay.},

We present a comprehensive literature review, supplemented with qualitative data obtained from interviews with experts in the field, to examine the policies and practices designed to ensure the safety of food produced by the Chinese aquaculture industry. The food safety system has many parts that are administered by different governmental organizations with poor coordination among them. The system apparently operates as two entities: one for products destined for the export market and based largely on the requirements of importing countries, and the other with lower standards and levels of enforcement for domestic market products. The top-down approach focuses more on the end product rather than the production practices. There are several indications that regulations pertaining to antibiotic use are not being followed. Recent events have brought the issue of overall food safety to the attention of the Chinese public and the Government is acting positively towards addressing deficiencies of the system. Chief among these is the Food Safety Law which comes into effect in June, 2009. But the central government must work in concert with provincial and local authorities to improve the infrastructure for inspecting and tracking food from farms to the end consumers to ensure a greater degree of safety of aquatic food for the Chinese population.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture activities are well known to be the major contributor to the increasing level of organic waste and toxic compound in the aquaculture industry. Along with the development of intensive aquaculture in China, concerns are evoked about the possible effects of ever-increasing aquaculture waste both on productivity inside the aquaculture system and on the ambient aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, it is apparent that appropriate waste treatment processes are needed for sustaining aquaculture development. This review aims at identifying the current status of aquaculture and aquaculture waste production in China.
China is the world's largest fishery nation in terms of total seafood production volume, a position it has maintained continuously since 1990. Freshwater aquaculture is a major part of the Chinese fishery industry. Marine aquaculture in China consists of both land-based and offshore aquaculture, with the latter mostly operated in shallow seas, mud flats and protected bays. The environmental impacts of aquaculture are also striking.
Case studies on pollution hot spots caused by aquaculture have been introduced. The quality and quantity of waste from aquaculture depends mainly on culture system characteristics and the choice of species, but also on feed quality and management. Wastewater without treatment, if continuously discharged into the aquatic environment, could result in remarkable elevation of the total organic matter contents and cause considerable economy lost. Waste treatments can be mainly classified into three categories: physical, chemical and biological methods.
The environmental impacts of different aquaculture species are not the same. New waste treatments are introduced as references for the potential development of the waste treatment system in China. The most appropriate waste treatment system for each site should be selected according to the sites' conditions and financial status as well as by weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each system. Strategies and perspectives for sustainable aquaculture development are proposed, with the emphasis on environmental protection.
Negative effects of waste from aquaculture to aquatic environment are increasingly recognized, though they were just a small proportion to land-based pollutants. Properly planned use of aquaculture waste alleviates water pollution problems and not only conserves valuable water resources but also takes advantage of the nutrients contained in effluent. It is highly demanding to develop sustainable aquaculture which keeps stocking density and pollution loadings under environmental capacity.
The traditional procedures for aquaculture waste treatment, mainly based on physical and chemical means, should be overcome by more site-specific approaches, taking into account the characteristics and resistibility of the aquatic environment. Further research needs to improve or optimize the current methods of wastewater treatment and reuse. Proposed new treatment technology should evaluate their feasibility at a larger scale for practical application.},

By the year 2000, at least 52 species belonging to 24 families of marine fish had been successfully bred. Large quantities of cultured fry can meet the needs of both sea cage culture and pond culture for most species. Fish fry production has entered a period of sustainable development. The number of artificially produced fry of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) exceeded 1.3 billion in year 2000. The species for which more than 10 million fry is produced annually through aquaculture are: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), redeye mullet (Liza haematocheila), cuneate drum (Nibea miichthioides), red seabream (Pagrosomus major), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and three-banded sweetlip (Plectorhynchus cinctus). Several millions of artificial fry are cultured annually for the following species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black porgy (Sparus macrocephalus), silver sea perch (Lates calcarifer), Russell's snapper (Lutjanus russelli), javelin grunt (Pomadasys hasta), miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy), Chinese black sleeper (Bostrichthys sinensis) and skewband grunt (Hapalogenys nitens). Fishes belonging to the family Sciaenidae are now the major species for artificial propagation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: China is responsible for more than 60\% of global aquaculture production. As the frontiers of food production have expanded, the cultivation of marine organisms in coastal zones and the open ocean has grown rapidly. The dominant mariculture industry in China is suspended mariculture, which uses net cages, ropes, or other structures suspended in the water column to cultivate aquatic organisms. This systematic, quantitative review provides a clear and comprehensive account of research that has investigated the adverse impacts of suspended mariculture in China and reviews research that has applied Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems for mitigating impacts. This work builds on 218 peer reviewed papers that have been published in English-language journals.Outcomes: Eighteen impacts were identified, including chemical, ecological, physical, and socioeconomic impacts. Eighteen measures for improving suspended mariculture were recommended consisting of government department, farm management, and ecological engineering measures. IMTA was the most frequently recommended measure. The capabilities of IMTA for bioremediation and increased farm production were the most frequently studied advantages. Seven other benefits have been explored but remain understudied. The current challenges facing the expansion of commercial IMTA include limited use of new technology, limited skills development, decreasing production of low trophic-level species, biogeographic and temporal barriers, and negative system feedbacks.Conclusion: Despite challenges, implementing commercial IMTA is a promising measure for reducing the impacts of suspended mariculture because it presents a range of secondary benefits that can improve the overall sustainability of aquaculture in the coastal zone.},

	abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) seeks to biodiversify fed aquaculture (e.g. finfish or shrimps) with extractive aquaculture, recapturing the inorganic (e.g. seaweeds) and organic (e.g. suspension- and deposit-feeders) nutrients from fed aquaculture for their growth. The combination fed/extractive aquaculture aims to engineer food production systems providing both biomitigative services to the ecosystem and improved economic farm output through the co-cultivation of complementary species. Major rethinking is needed regarding the definition of an ‘aquaculture farm’ and how it works within an ecosystem. The economic values of the environmental/societal services of extractive species should be recognized and accounted for in the evaluation of the full value of these IMTA components. Seaweeds and invertebrates produced in IMTA systems should be considered as candidates for nutrient/carbon trading credits. While organic loading from aquaculture has been associated with localized benthic impacts, there have also been occurrences of increased biodiversity and abundance of wild species in response to moderate nutrient enrichment and the use of infrastructures as substrates. To develop efficient food production systems, it will be important to understand and use the duality of nutrients (essential when limiting/polluting when in excess) to engineer systems producing them in moderation so that they can be partially recaptured while maintaining their concentrations optimal for healthy and productive ecosystems. Measures of species diversity, colonization rates, abundance, growth and ecosystem functions with respect to nutrient partitioning and recycling, species interactions and control of diseases could represent valid indicators for the development of robust performance metrics.},

* Spatial management is used also to optimize yields or protect key parts of the life cycle of species that are utilized (hunted, farmed or fished), for example through rotational harvesting.


* To evaluate the effectiveness of marine spatial closures with conflicting fisheries and conservation objectives, a series of marine fisheries closures are here analysed using an integrative modelling tool known as management strategy evaluation (MSE).


* This modelling framework combines a food web model of a tropical ecosystem fished by a prawn (shrimp) fishery that emulates the resource being managed, together with the present management system and risk-based tools of fishing the prawn species at maximum economic yield.


* A series of spatial closures are designed and tested with the aim of investigating trade-offs among biodiversity (MPA), benthic impacts, ecosystem function, key species at risk to fishing, economic and sustainability objectives.


* Synthesis and applications. This paper illustrates that existing tools often available in actively managed fisheries can be linked together into an effective management strategy evaluation framework. Spatial closures tended to succeed with respect to their specific design objective, but this benefit did not necessarily flow to other broad-scale objectives. This demonstrates that there is no single management tool which satisfies all objectives, and that a suite of management tools is needed.},

	abstract = {Recently an action plan has been put in place off southeastern Portugal, consisting in an offshore aquaculture area off the Armona sandy barrier island, Armona Pilot Production Aquaculture Area (APPAA). The infrastructure was created after the initiative of the Portuguese Government aiming to stimulate local employment opportunities related to seafood production. The APPAA aims to improve resilience of finfish and shellfish production for the future. However, the delimited infrastructure is located nearby some fishery-dependent communities. Therefore, such proximity may cause friction with some fishermen due to the limitations post APPAA development (e.g. may feel their jobs are threatened). In this study, we queried the reasoning rules elicited by local fishing communities and their perceived impact of the APPAA implementation. In that scope, a fuzzy logic expert system approach was used to investigate the interaction between three input variables (namely, ‘availability of fishable area’, ‘navigational disturbance’, and ‘catch variation’) and the output variable (i.e., overall ‘fishing community satisfaction’). The results from the fuzzy logic expert system showed that ‘catch variation’ was the input that most affected ‘fishing community satisfaction’ and seemed to be the one that suffered most changes. The results also show that, for the analyzed years, where the catch was higher, the degree of satisfaction tended to follow the trend, independently of the fishing community. The other two input variables were more conditioned by governmental arrangement (‘availability of fishable area’) and by small-scale fishermen reaction (‘navigational disturbance’). The fuzzy logic expert system proved to be a valuable tool, facilitating the analysis of governance arrangements, particularly those dealing with the interaction between the fisheries–offshore aquaculture system as a whole.},

An inshore multi-species fishery that dates back to the earliest European settlement shares these waters, and has been the economic mainstay of coastal communities. These inshore fishermen are increasingly displaced by the expanding aquaculture industry. A recent study conducted among fishermen in Southwest New Brunswick recorded their observations about the environmental impact of finfish aquaculture and the consequences for their commercial fishery. Fishermen all reported significant environmental degradation around aquaculture sites. Within 2 years of an operation being established, fishermen reported that gravid female lobsters as well as herring avoid the area, scallop and sea urchin shells become brittle, scallop meat and sea urchin roe becomes discolored. The use of chemicals to control sea lice on farmed salmon has also caused lobster, crab and shrimp kills. These and other concerns suggest that more comprehensive and detailed studies are required to establish the environmental and economic interactions of aquaculture and the inshore fishery, as well as on the stocks on which that fishery rely. The study also points to the need for more effective use of fishermen’s knowledge in designing such studies.},

	abstract = {The agricultural world today is dominated by a few domesticated mammal species, that is, animals modified from their wild ancestors through selective breeding in captivity for traits beneficial to human usages. As a result, a clear dichotomy exists between wild (from hunting) and domesticated mammals (produced in farms) used for human consumption. Similar to agriculture, aquaculture is often viewed as the only solution that can provide more fish products given that harvesting wild stocks have reached an upper limit. Aquaculture is considerably younger than agriculture relying on natural sources to farm numerous species. To better describe the diverse strategies for fish production, we propose a new classification comprising five levels of ‘domestication’ with 1 being the least to 5 being the most domesticated. Our classification places 70\% of the 250 farmed finfish species recorded in the 2009 FAO database into levels 1, 2 and 3 representing a transitory form of fish production dependent on the availability of the wild resource. In contrast, only a few species, or more accurately populations, can be considered truly domesticated, similar to cattle or sheep. Based on this classification, two scenarios for the future of aquaculture are discussed: either the industry focuses on few truly domesticated species, similar to the path taken by agriculture, but avoiding its negative impacts or aquaculture proceeds with inter-specific diversification by focusing primarily on the domestication of native species.},

The model is solved for the optimal harvest pattern and calculates economic profit and net present value for a model farm. The biological sub-model incorporates knowledge from interviews with existing farmers, research trials and existing cod aquaculture literature. Economic components are obtained from interviews and sales statistics from exporters. A farm of the modeled scale is likely to influence market prices, hence sales prices were estimated assuming a supply response based on the price elasticity. Taking into account the opportunity cost of selling the fish directly, NPV is found to be marginally positive. Sensitivity analysis revealed that profitability is sensitive to changes in several parameters. Hence, further research is valuable and care should be taken when considering investments in cod CBA.},

	abstract = {Fishes farmed in sea pens may become infested by parasites from wild fishes and in turn become point sources for parasites. Sea lice, copepods of the family Caligidae, are the best-studied example of this risk. Sea lice are the most significant parasitic pathogen in salmon farming in Europe and the Americas, are estimated to cost the world industry €300 million a year and may also be pathogenic to wild fishes under natural conditions.
Epizootics, characteristically dominated by juvenile (copepodite and chalimus) stages, have repeatedly occurred on juvenile wild salmonids in areas where farms have sea lice infestations, but have not been recorded elsewhere. This paper synthesizes the literature, including modelling studies, to provide an understanding of how one species, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, can infest wild salmonids from farm sources. Three-dimensional hydrographic models predicted the distribution of the planktonic salmon lice larvae best when they accounted for wind-driven surface currents and larval behaviour. Caligus species can also cause problems on farms and transfer from farms to wild fishes, and this genus is cosmopolitan. Sea lice thus threaten finfish farming worldwide, but with the possible exception of L. salmonis, their host relationships and transmission adaptations are unknown. The increasing evidence that lice from farms can be a significant cause of mortality on nearby wild fish populations provides an additional challenge to controlling lice on the farms and also raises conservation, economic and political issues about how to balance aquaculture and fisheries resource management.},

Diseases in individuals which offer some commercial value are often well documented and subsequently well studied in comparison to those wild groups offering little commercial gain. This is particularly the case with those associated with mariculture or the commercial fisheries. Specifically, these include many Holothuroidea, and numerous crustacea and mollusca species. Pathogens/parasites consisting of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all groups have been associated with diseases from such organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Viral pathogens in particular, appear to be an increasingly important group and research into this group will likely highlight a larger number of diseases and pathogens being described in the near future. Interestingly, although there are countless examples of the spread of disease usually associated with transportation of specific infected hosts for development of aquaculture practices, this process appears to be continuing with no real sign of effective management and mitigation strategies being implicated. Notably, even in well developed countries such as the UK and the US, even though live animal trade may be well managed, the transport of frozen food appears to be less well so and as evidence suggests, even these to have the potential to transmit pathogens when used as a food source for example.},

Several recent studies have reached contradictory conclusions on whether the spread of lice from salmon farms affects the productivity of sympatric wild salmon populations. We analyzed recently available sea lice data on farms and spawner–recruit data for pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon populations in the Broughton Archipelago and nearby regions where farms are not present. Our results show that sea lice abundance on farms is negatively associated with productivity of both pink and coho salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. These results reconcile the contradictory findings of previous studies and suggest that management and policy measures designed to protect wild salmon from sea lice should yield conservation and fishery benefits.},

	abstract = {Increased farm salmon production has heightened concerns about the association between disease on farm and wild fish. The controversy is particularly evident in the Broughton Archipelago of Western Canada, where a high prevalence of sea lice (ectoparasitic copepods) was first reported on juvenile wild pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in 2001. Exposure to sea lice from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was thought to be the cause of the 97\% population decline before these fish returned to spawn in 2002, although no diagnostic investigation was done to rule out other causes of mortality. To address the concern that sea lice from fish farms would cause population extinction of wild salmon, we analyzed 10–20 y of fish farm data and 60 y of pink salmon data. We show that the number of pink salmon returning to spawn in the fall predicts the number of female sea lice on farm fish the next spring, which, in turn, accounts for 98\% of the annual variability in the prevalence of sea lice on outmigrating wild juvenile salmon. However, productivity of wild salmon is not negatively associated with either farm lice numbers or farm fish production, and all published field and laboratory data support the conclusion that something other than sea lice caused the population decline in 2002. We conclude that separating farm salmon from wild salmon—proposed through coordinated fallowing or closed containment—will not increase wild salmon productivity and that medical analysis can improve our understanding of complex issues related to aquaculture sustainability.},

	abstract = {The large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), endemic to East Asia was once one of the three top commercial marine fishes of China PR. Heavily exploited since the 1950s, wild stocks were so severely depleted by the 1980s that most individuals subsequently sold originated from hatcheries. After peaking at about 200 000 tonnes in the mid-1970s, catches of the croaker in China PR declined by over 90\% within just 2 decades; according to most decline criteria this would categorize the croaker as “threatened” and management measures, including restocking, were developed. The extensive government-sponsored mariculture program introduced to address food supply and overfishing in the 1980s, particularly of the croaker, was one of the earliest for marine finfish, not only in China PR, a nation with a rich and highly successful history in aquaculture, but globally. In this first, in-depth, profile of a key fishery and early mariculture development, we integrate ecological and biological information with the fishing, management, mariculture and economic history to trace the collapse of wild stocks and assess why management and mariculture did not result in wild stock recovery. Evidence strongly suggests that a combination of heavy exploitation of spawning and over-wintering aggregations, poor management and overfishing pressure were major factors in stock declines, with contributions from pollution, habitat degradation and marine ecosystem shift. Although the croaker proved a highly successful mariculture candidate, with approximately 70 000 tonnes produced in 2005, the highest of any marine fish cultured in China PR, mariculture and restocking have failed to restore croaker stocks and may have, inadvertently, led to biodiversity losses. The detailed history of the croaker is a sobering reminder that successful mariculture, albeit important for food production and livelihoods, is not necessarily a solution to overfishing, and moreover, may have compromised fishery recovery by competing for funds, attention, space, and maybe genetic resources.},

Depending on the sturdiness of farms already producing, such a shift in the industry may affect production costs of exclusively using organic fry for production. If the profitability of the primary organic aquaculture producers should be maintained, then farmers must be able to correspondingly receive higher prices, transmitted through the value chain from the retail market. This study identifies the price premium for organic salmon in Danish retail sale using consumer panel scanner data from households by applying a random effect hedonic price model that permits unobserved household heterogeneity. A price premium of 20\% was identified for organic salmon. The magnitude of this premium is comparable to organic labeled agricultural products and higher than that of eco-labeled capture fishery products, such as the Marine Stewardship Council. This indicates that the organic label also used for agricultural products may be better known and trusted among consumers than the eco-labels on capture fishery products.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing focus on environmentally sustainable seafood, which creates a potential for segmentation in the seafood market. Several recent studies demonstrate that consumers prefer ecolabeled wild seafood over unlabeled seafood. In addition, there is increasing evidence of a preference for wild fish relative to farmed fish, despite the rapid increase of aquaculture production. Recently, ecolabels have also been introduced for farmed fish. An interesting question is whether the preference for wild fish is primarily related to the perceived lack of environmental sustainability in aquaculture, or whether it is a perceived quality difference. In this paper, a choice experiment is used to investigate these issues in Germany for salmon using the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) ecolabel for farmed salmon and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) ecolabel for wild salmon. Using a mixed logit model, the random parameter specification indicates substantial variation in consumer preferences beyond demographic variables. With respect to the main question, the ASC ecolabel not only makes up for the negative association of farmed salmon, but gives a similar price for the ASC labeled salmon as for MSC labeled wild salmon. This is an indication that environmental concerns and not quality differences are the major issue in segmenting the market between farmed and wild fish.},

	abstract = {While artificial reefs may have much to offer, they remain an anecdote in the greater scheme of fisheries management, primarily due to the lack of data specific to validating their use. Based on papers presented at the 9th Conference on Artificial Reefs and Artificial Habitats (CARAH) and also including original articles written for this reference, Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management brings to the forefront the current state of knowledge regarding artificial reefs and their pragmatic application to furthering fisheries sustainability. It presents a timely compilation of research to increase options for the implementation of artificial reefs for fishery and natural resource managers.  Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management offers an inclusive and encompassing description of the field by chapter authors drawn from diverse geographical areas. This approach gives readers the broadest of perspectives and reflects regional interests and experience with artificial reefs in different parts of the world.   Coming at an opportune time in the field of artificial reefs, Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management aids researchers and natural resource managers more carefully consider the special features of artificial reefs in their application to resolving fisheries management problems. This book is an important step toward improving the prescribed use of artificial reefs as a viable option in many of the world’s fisheries in the quest to make more of the world’s fisheries sustainable.},

We tested the hypothesis that fish abundance and species composition vary between feeding and non-feeding periods and different bottom substrates within a Sparus aurata (L.) farm. Sampling took place during feeding and non-feeding periods on six consecutive days in July 2011. Visual censuses were carried out at three different depths and at three sampling stations over rocky–sandy and sandy substrates respectively. In all, 33 species belonging to 17 families were observed. Total fish abundance, biomass and species community significantly differed between feeding and non-feeding periods. Each depth was represented by a distinct species community and was therefore affected differently by the feeding activity. At the surface, fish abundance was significantly higher during feeding compared with non-feeding periods. The distance from the feeding vessel significantly influenced fish aggregations in the water column, indicating that planktivorous species learnt to associate the boat noise with food availability through classic conditioning. At the bottom, substrate type was the dominant factor explaining aggregation variability. This study provides new information about the dynamics of fish aggregations within farms, emphasizing the importance of considering the different sources of variability in future study designs.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Aggregations of wild fish were counted around 9 floating sea-cage fish farms along a 300 km stretch of the Spanish coastline in the south-western Mediterranean Sea. Each fish farm cultivated Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax in 6 to 16 floating sea cages between 10 m and 7.4 km from the coast. During September and October 2001, assemblages of fish were counted on 3 separate days at each of 9 farms. Six 5 min rapid visual counts using SCUBA and covering 11 250 m³ were performed within each farm complex and at open water control sites 200 m distant from farms. Abundance (52 to 2837×), biomass (2.8 to 1126×) and number of species (1.6 to 14×) were greater in fish farm counts than control counts at all locations. Twenty-seven species were recorded at fish farms, with 2 families, Sparidae (12 species) and Carangidae (4 species), being particularly abundant. Over 85\% of farm-associated fish were of adult size. Assemblages of wild fish differed greatly between farms separated by 10s to 100s of km, although there was some evidence to suggest that similar assemblages occur at farms separated by 100s of m to several km. Abundance, biomass and number of species differed among fish farms, with all 3 variables negatively correlated with distance of farms from shore and positively correlated with size of farms. Limited variability of wild fish assemblages and abundance of the dominant taxa at each farm among times sampled indicated some degree of temporal stability on a scale of several weeks. Due to the strong aggregative effect of fish farms, possible residence of fishes for periods of weeks to months and the prohibition of fishing within farm leasehold areas, we suggest that coastal sea-cage fish farms may act as small (up to 160 000 m²), pelagic marine protected areas (MPAs). Furthermore, at farms where wild fish are abundant, ecological interactions that may influence both wild fish stocks and the impact of farms must be considered.},

We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about \$16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20\% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was \$5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable (\$11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:The outbreak, persistence, and eradication of infectious diseases often depend on the density of hosts. In coastal seas, many fisheries are fully or over-exploited; meanwhile, farmed populations are increasing rapidly with aquaculture growth. Marine aquaculture facilities are typically open to the surrounding ecosystem and, therefore, wild and farmed populations are connected by their shared parasites. At the core of epidemiological theory are host density thresholds, above which diseases can persist or invade and below which diseases can be eradicated. Host density thresholds in aquaculture–fishery interactions likely function at regional scales that encompass multiple farms, which are connected by pathogen dispersal and the movement of wild hosts. Sudden outbreaks of parasitic copepods in wild-farmed salmon systems may be linked to aquaculture growth exceeding host density thresholds. Abiotic (e.g. temperature and salinity), management (e.g. husbandry and farm siting), and biotic factors (e.g. migrations of wild hosts) likely affect threshold values. A connected wild-farmed host population can exceed a host density threshold due to an influx of wild hosts via migration, increases in aquaculture production, or environmental change such as climate warming. Coastal management and policy should heed the disease implications of climate warming, aquaculture growth, and fisheries restoration that suggest increasing host densities and decreasing threshold values.},

These include increased globalization of trade and markets; the intensification of fish-farming practices through the movement of broodstock, postlarvae, fry and fingerlings; the introduction of new species for aquaculture development; the expansion of the ornamental fish trade; the enhancement of marine and coastal areas through the stocking of aquatic animals raised in hatcheries; the unanticipated interactions between cultured and wild populations of aquatic animals; poor or lack of effective biosecurity measures; slow awareness on emerging diseases; the misunderstanding and misuse of specific pathogen free (SPF) stocks; climate change; other human-mediated movements of aquaculture commodities. Data on the socio-economic impacts of aquatic animal diseases are also presented, including estimates of losses in production, direct and indirect income and employment, market access or share of investment, and consumer confidence; food availability; industry failures. Examples of costs of investment in aquatic animal health-related activities, including national strategies, research, surveillance, control and other health management programmes are also provided. Finally, the strategies currently being implemented in the Asian region to deal with transboundary diseases affecting the aquaculture sector are highlighted. These include compliance with international codes, and development and implementation of regional guidelines and national aquatic animal health strategies; new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and new information technology; new biosecurity measures including risk analysis, epidemiology, surveillance, reporting and planning for emergency response to epizootics; targeted research; institutional strengthening and manpower development (education, training and extension research and diagnostic services).},

	abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture has grown rapidly over several decades to become a major global industry that serves the increasing consumer demand for seafood and has contributed significantly to socio-economic development in many poor coastal communities. However, the ecological disturbances and changes in patterns of trade associated with the development of shrimp farming have presented many of the pre-conditions for the emergence and spread of disease. Shrimp are displaced from their natural environments, provided artificial or alternative feeds, stocked in high density, exposed to stress through changes in water quality and are transported nationally and internationally, either live or as frozen product. These practices have provided opportunities for increased pathogenicity of existing infections, exposure to new pathogens, and the rapid transmission and transboundary spread of disease. Not surprisingly, a succession of new viral diseases has devastated the production and livelihoods of farmers and their sustaining communities. This review examines the major viral pathogens of farmed shrimp, the likely reasons for their emergence and spread, and the consequences for the structure and operation of the shrimp farming industry. In addition, this review discusses the health management strategies that have been introduced to combat the major pathogens and the reasons that disease continues to have an impact, particularly on poor, small-holder farmers in Asia.},

	abstract = {Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, are naturally occurring parasites of salmon in sea water. Intensive salmon farming provides better conditions for parasite growth and transmission compared with natural conditions, creating problems for both the salmon farming industry and, under certain conditions, wild salmonids. Salmon lice originating from farms negatively impact wild stocks of salmonids, although the extent of the impact is a matter of debate. Estimates from Ireland and Norway indicate an odds ratio of 1.1:1-1.2:1 for sea lice treated Atlantic salmon smolt to survive sea migration compared to untreated smolts. This is considered to have a moderate population regulatory effect. The development of resistance against drugs most commonly used to treat salmon lice is a serious concern for both wild and farmed fish. Several large initiatives have been taken to encourage the development of new strategies, such as vaccines and novel drugs, for the treatment or removal of salmon lice from farmed fish. The newly sequenced salmon louse genome will be an important tool in this work. The use of cleaner fish has emerged as a robust method for controlling salmon lice, and aquaculture production of wrasse is important towards this aim. Salmon lice have large economic consequences for the salmon industry, both as direct costs for the prevention and treatment, but also indirectly through negative public opinion.},

The latter is illustrated by the widespread and unrestricted use of prophylactic antibiotics in this industry, especially in developing countries, to forestall bacterial infections resulting from sanitary shortcomings in fish rearing. The use of a wide variety of antibiotics in large amounts, including non-biodegradable antibiotics useful in human medicine, ensures that they remain in the aquatic environment, exerting their selective pressure for long periods of time. This process has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in aquaculture environments, in the increase of antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens, in the transfer of these resistance determinants to bacteria of land animals and to human pathogens, and in alterations of the bacterial flora both in sediments and in the water column. The use of large amounts of antibiotics that have to be mixed with fish food also creates problems for industrial health and increases the opportunities for the presence of residual antibiotics in fish meat and fish products. Thus, it appears that global efforts are needed to promote more judicious use of prophylactic antibiotics in aquaculture as accumulating evidence indicates that unrestricted use is detrimental to fish, terrestrial animals, and human health and the environment.},

However, at present, there exists great concern over the widespread use of antibiotics in aquaculture, which may result in residue of antibiotics in water and mud, and subsequently, the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria in the environment. There is limited understanding about the effect of antibiotic residues on bacteria resistance in shrimp farming environment. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate bacterial resistance to Norfloxacin (NFXC), Oxolinic Acid (OXLA), Trimethoprim (TMP) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which were found in four shrimp farming locations in mangrove areas in Vietnam. Findings indicate that there is a relatively high incidence of bacteria resistance to these antibiotics observed in most of the studied sites, particularly to antibiotics with concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Yet the relation between concentration of antibiotic residues and incidence of antibiotic resistance is not clearly defined. Among individual antibiotics, the incidence of resistance to TMP and SMX was higher than the others. Identification of bacteria isolated from mud samples by DNA analyzer shows that Bacillus and Vibrio are predominant among bacteria resistant to the antibiotics. The result of the study also indicates that these antibiotics in media degraded more rapidly due to the presence of resistant bacteria.},

	abstract = {The historical, political and scientific aspects of salmon hatchery programmes designed to enhance fishery production, or to recover endangered populations, are reviewed. We start by pointing out that the establishment of hatcheries has been a political response to societal demands for harvest and conservation; given this social context, we then critically examined the levels of activity, the biological risks, and the economic analysis associated with salmon hatchery programmes. A rigorous analysis of the impacts of hatchery programmes was hindered by the lack of standardized data on release sizes and survival rates at all ecological scales, and since hatchery programme objectives are rarely defined, it was also difficult to measure their effectiveness at meeting release objectives. Debates on the genetic effects of hatchery programmes on wild fish have been dominated by whether correct management practices can reduce negative outcomes, but we noted that there has been an absence of programmatic research approaches addressing this important issue. Competitive interactions between hatchery and wild fish were observed to be complex, but studies researching approaches to reduce these interactions at all ecological scales during the entire salmon life history have been rare, and thus are not typically considered in hatchery management. Harvesting of salmon released from fishery enhancement hatcheries likely impacts vulnerable wild populations; managers have responded to this problem by mass marking hatchery fish, so that fishing effort can be directed towards hatchery populations. However, we noted that the effectiveness of this approach is dependant on accurate marking and production of hatchery fish with high survival rates, and it is not yet clear whether selective fishing will prevent overharvest of wild populations. Finally, research demonstrating disease transmission from hatchery fish to wild populations was observed to be equivocal; evidence in this area has been constrained by the lack of effective approaches to studying the fate of pathogens in the wild. We then reviewed several approaches to studying the economic consequences of hatchery activities intended to inform the social decisions surrounding programmes, but recognized that placing monetary value on conservation efforts or on hatcheries that mitigate cultural groups’ loss of historical harvest opportunities may complicate these analyses. We noted that economic issues have rarely been included in decision making on hatchery programmes. We end by identifying existing major knowledge gaps, which, if filled, could contribute towards a fuller understanding of the role that hatchery programmes could play in meeting divergent goals. However, we also recognized that many management recommendations arising from such research may involve trade-offs between different risks, and that decisions about these trade-offs must occur within a social context. Hatcheries have played an important role in sustaining some highly endangered populations, and it is possible that reform of practices will lead to an increase in the number of successful programmes. However, a serious appraisal of the role of hatcheries in meeting broader needs is urgently warranted and should take place at the scientific, but more effectively, at the societal level.},

In particular, Pacific salmon are artificially propagated in enormous numbers in order to compensate for numerous human insults to their populations, yet the ecological impacts of this massive hatchery effort are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that massive numbers of hatchery–raised chinook salmon reduce the marine survival of wild Snake River spring chinook, a threatened species in the USA. Based on a unique 25–year time–series, we demonstrated a strong, negative relationship between the survival of chinook salmon and the number of hatchery fish released, particularly during years of poor ocean conditions. Our results suggest that hatchery programmes that produce increasingly higher numbers of fish may hinder the recovery of depleted wild populations.},

	abstract = {Hatchery fish stocking for stock enhancement has been operated at a massive and global scale. However, the use of hatchery fish as a means of stock enhancement is highly controversial, and little is known about its effects on wild stock and consequences for stock enhancement. Here we review the scientific literature on this subject in order to address a fundamental question — is hatchery stocking a help or harm for wild stock and stock enhancement? We summarized 266 peer-reviewed papers that were published in the last 50years, which describe empirical case studies on ecology and genetics of hatchery stocks and their effects on stock enhancement. Specifically, we asked whether hatchery stock and wild stock differed in fitness and the level of genetic variation, and whether stocking affected population abundance. Seventy studies contained comparisons between hatchery and wild stocks, out of which 23 studies showed significantly negative effects of hatchery rearing on the fitness of stocked fish, and 28 studies showed reduced genetic variation in hatchery populations. None of these studies suggested a positive genetic effect on the fitness of hatchery-reared individuals after release. These results suggest that negative effects of hatchery rearing are not just a concern but undeniably present in many aquaculture species. In a few cases, however, no obvious effect of hatchery rearing was observed, and a positive contribution of hatchery stock to the abundance of fish populations was indicated. These examples suggest that there is a chance to improve hatchery practices and mitigate the negative effects on wild stocks, although scientific data supporting the positive effect on stock enhancement are largely missing at this moment. Technically, microsatellite-based parentage assignments have been proven as a useful tool for the evaluation of reproductive fitness in natural settings, which is a key for stock enhancement by hatchery-based stocking. We discuss implications of these results, as well as their limitations and future directions.},

Capture fisheries have been stabilized at about 90 million metric tons since the late 1980s, whereas aquaculture increased from 12 million metric tons in 1985 to 45 million metric tons by 2004. Aquaculture includes species at any trophic level that are grown for domestic consumption or export. Aquaculture has some positive impacts on biodiversity; for example, cultured seafood can reduce pressure on overexploited wild stocks, stocked organisms may enhance depleted stocks, aquaculture often boosts natural production and species diversity, and employment in aquaculture may replace more destructive resource uses. On the negative side, species that escape from aquaculture can become invasive in areas where they are nonnative, effluents from aquaculture can cause eutrophication, ecologically sensitive land may be converted for aquaculture use, aquaculture species may consume increasingly scarce fish meal, and aquaculture species may transmit diseases to wild fish. Most likely, aquaculture will continue to grow at significant rates through 2025, and will remain the most rapidly increasing food production system.},

	abstract = {World food prices hit an all-time high in February 2011 and are still almost two and a half times those of 2000. Although three billion people worldwide use seafood as a key source of animal protein, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations–which compiles prices for other major food categories–has not tracked seafood prices. We fill this gap by developing an index of global seafood prices that can help to understand food crises and may assist in averting them. The fish price index (FPI) relies on trade statistics because seafood is heavily traded internationally, exposing non-traded seafood to price competition from imports and exports. Easily updated trade data can thus proxy for domestic seafood prices that are difficult to observe in many regions and costly to update with global coverage. Calculations of the extent of price competition in different countries support the plausibility of reliance on trade data. Overall, the FPI shows less volatility and fewer price spikes than other food price indices including oils, cereals, and dairy. The FPI generally reflects seafood scarcity, but it can also be separated into indices by production technology, fish species, or region. Splitting FPI into capture fisheries and aquaculture suggests increased scarcity of capture fishery resources in recent years, but also growth in aquaculture that is keeping pace with demand. Regionally, seafood price volatility varies, and some prices are negatively correlated. These patterns hint that regional supply shocks are consequential for seafood prices in spite of the high degree of seafood tradability.},

	abstract = {Each year, hundreds of thousands of domesticated farmed Atlantic salmon escape into the wild. In Norway, which is the world’s largest commercial producer, many native Atlantic salmon populations have experienced large numbers of escapees on the spawning grounds for the past 15–30 years. In order to study the potential genetic impact, we conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of 3049 fish from 21 populations throughout Norway, sampled in the period 1970–2010. Based upon the analysis of 22 microsatellites, individual admixture, FST and increased allelic richness revealed temporal genetic changes in six of the populations. These changes were highly significant in four of them. For example, 76\% and 100\% of the fish comprising the contemporary samples for the rivers Vosso and Opo were excluded from their respective historical samples at P = 0.001. Based upon several genetic parameters, including simulations, genetic drift was excluded as the primary cause of the observed genetic changes. In the remaining 15 populations, some of which had also been exposed to high numbers of escapees, clear genetic changes were not detected. Significant population genetic structuring was observed among the 21 populations in the historical (global FST = 0.038) and contemporary data sets (global FST = 0.030), although significantly reduced with time (P = 0.008). This reduction was especially distinct when looking at the six populations displaying temporal changes (global FST dropped from 0.058 to 0.039, P = 0.006). We draw two main conclusions: 1. The majority of the historical population genetic structure throughout Norway still appears to be retained, suggesting a low to modest overall success of farmed escapees in the wild; 2. Genetic introgression of farmed escapees in native salmon populations has been strongly population-dependent, and it appears to be linked with the density of the native population.},

To guide environmentally sustainable expansion, coastal stakeholders require tools to evaluate the risks that marine aquaculture poses and to craft science-based policies and practices which safeguard marine ecosystems. We summarized current knowledge regarding dissolved nutrient loading from marine fish farms around the world, direct impacts on water quality and secondary impacts on primary production, including formation of harmful algal blooms. We found that modern operating conditions have minimized impacts of individual fish farms on marine water quality. Effects on dissolved oxygen and turbidity are largely eliminated through better management. Nutrient enrichment of the near-field water column is not detectable beyond 100 m of a farm when formulated feeds are used, and feed waste is minimized. We highlight the role of siting fish farms in deep waters with sufficient current to disperse nutrients and prevent water quality impacts. We extensively discuss the potential for advances in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) to assimilate waste nutrients. Although modern farm management practices have decreased environmental effects of marine fish farms, we conclude that questions remain about the additive impacts of discharge from multiple farms potentially leading to increased primary production and eutrophication. Research results on secondary effects upon primary production are highly variable. In some locations, nutrient loading has little or no trophic impact, while at others there is evidence that nutrients are assimilated by primary producers. Research on far-field and regional processes, especially in intensively farmed areas and over longer time scales, will refine understanding of the full ecological role of fish farms in marine environments.},

The ability of U.S. shrimpers to mediate supply shocks through increased prices hinges on the degree of market integration, both among shrimp of different sizes classes and between U.S. wild caught shrimp and imported farmed shrimp. We use detailed data on shrimp prices by size class and import prices to conduct a co-integration analysis of market integration in the shrimp industry. We find significant evidence of market integration, suggesting that the law of one price holds for this industry. Hence, in the face of a supply shocks, prices do not rise; instead, imports of foreign farmed fish increase.},

	abstract = {The white sturgeon population Acipenser transmontanus in the Kootenai River was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1994 due to postglacial isolation and the virtual lack of recruitment since 1974. The Kootenai River White Sturgeon Conservation Aquaculture Program was initiated to preserve genetic variability, begin rebuilding natural age-class structure, and prevent extinction while measures are identified and implemented to restore natural recruitment. The program is part of a comprehensive recovery strategy detailed in the USFWS recovery plan for the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon. A breeding plan, including culture methods to minimize potential detrimental effects of conventional stocking programs, has been implemented to guide recovery, population management, and the systematic collection and spawning of wild adults before they are lost from the wild breeding population. Between 1990 and 2000, 33 families were produced from the mating of 51 wild white sturgeon broodstock. Genetic analysis indicated that five mitochondrial control region length variants represented in the wild white sturgeon population were represented in similar frequencies in the wild white sturgeon broodstock. A total of 2,702 hatchery-reared white sturgeon were released into the Kootenai River between 1992 and 1999. White sturgeon juveniles approved for release had no diagnostic disease symptoms and less than or equal to 10\% prevalence of endemic pathogens. A total of 398 hatchery-reared fish were recaptured in the wild (14.7\% of 2,702 stocked; single recapture events) during the 1993-1999 sampling period. The Kootenai River Conservation Aquaculture Program is currently meeting its objectives of reducing the threat of population extinction by providing frequent year classes from native broodstock, representing inherent within-population genetic diversity in its broodstock and progeny, and minimizing the introduction of disease into the recipient wild population.},

Supply side policies, however, often neglect the institutional framework within which the wildlife trade takes place, and ignore the potential strategic responses of economic agents.

	abstract = {The wide variety of goods and services provided by the coastal zone (food, medicines, nutrient recycling, control of flooding, typhoon protection) account for its many uses (fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture, human settlements, harbors, ports, tourism, industries). Aquaculture now provides a third of total fisheries production. Half of the total aquaculture yield comes from land-based ponds and water-based pens, cages, longlines and stakes in brackish water and marine habitats. But the opportunities for employment, income and foreign exchange from coastal aquaculture have been overshadowed by negative environmental and social effects. The environmental impacts include: mangrove loss, bycatch during collection of wild seed and broodstock, introductions and transfers of species, spread of parasites and diseases, misuse of chemicals, and release of wastes. The socioeconomic impacts include: privatization of public lands and waterways, loss of fisheries livelihoods, food insecurity, and urban migration. The paper gives recommendations on the attainment of responsible and sustainable aquaculture with emphasis on herbivorous and omnivorous species, polyculture, integration with agriculture and mangroves, and self-regulation in the form of codes of conduct and best management practices. Recommended approaches include holistic Integrated Coastal Zone Management based on stakeholder needs, mechanisms for conflict resolution, assimilative capacity of the environment, protection of community resources, and rehabilitation of degraded habitats, to improvements in the aquaculture sector pertaining to management of feed, water, and effluents.},

In this paper, the impact of improved fisheries management on aquaculture growth is studied assuming perfect substitution between farmed and wild fish.

Seagrasses are protected by no-net-loss provisions in US federal and state regulations, resulting in precautionary management that avoids any direct impacts from development activity, including shellfish aquaculture. Recent research suggests that oyster aquaculture has direct impacts on native seagrass (eelgrass Zostera marina) at small spatial and short temporal scales in US west coast estuaries. We quantified impacts of oyster aquaculture on Z. marina at the estuarine landscape scale in Willapa Bay, Washington. A model of Z. marina cover outside of aquaculture was created using distance to estuary mouth, distance to nearest channel, salinity, elevation, and cumulative wave stress as factors, and was then used to predict Z. marina distribution within oyster aquaculture beds and compared to an inverse distance interpolation of points outside of aquaculture. The amount of Z. marina cover observed within oyster aquaculture beds was less than predicted, but represented {\textless}1.5\% of the total predicted amount of Z. marina cover in Willapa Bay in any year. Type of oyster culture bed did not contribute to observed variation, but mechanically harvested beds had significantly less Z. marina cover than beds harvested by other methods. The majority of beds had 65-145\% of the model-predicted Z. marina cover and exhibited relatively low variability between years, suggesting that Z. marina as habitat is resilient to oyster aquaculture as a disturbance and does not result in persistent effects at the landscape scale in this estuary.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have hypothesized reduced eelgrass distribution in areas exposed to suspended bag oyster aquaculture of Crassostrea virginica in Eastern Canada is related to shading from aquaculture stock and equipment. The results of a 359-day manipulative field experiment support this hypothesis. Reductions in underwater light, at levels comparable to those found at suspended oyster operations, caused reduced eelgrass structure, morphometrics, and photosynthesis. Increased organic matter deposition under suspended bags neither led to biologically relevant declines in eelgrass metrics, nor mitigated the effects of light limitation. Shoot density, above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, canopy height, leaf area index, leaf width, and photosynthetic capacity were all significantly reduced. These variables declined along a gradient of increased shading, with significant responses detected in as few as 67days after exposure to 26\% subsurface irradiance. Subsequent sampling 253days after the removal of experimental treatments documented the potential for recovery in the form of seedling recruitment to the plots of heaviest impact. However, eelgrass response variables remained significantly reduced relative to controls, indicating previous assumptions of a rapid recovery potential for eelgrass exposed to suspended bag oyster aquaculture were incorrect.},

It is apparent that operational managers and fish farmers have great responsibility when it comes to preventing escape. Severe consequences for individuals and companies if fish escape may lead to workers prioritizing the safety of the fish over their own safety. Accident causality is often complex.

A total of 8,922,863 fish were reported to have escaped from 242 incidents. Of these over 5 million occurred in two catastrophic escape incidents. Sea bream accounted for the highest number of escapes at 76.7\% followed by Atlantic salmon at 9.2\%. Of the 113 Atlantic salmon escape events, almost 75\% were due to structure failure or operational error. Almost 50\% of cod escape incidents were due to biological causes e.g. biting of nets. The nominal costs of escapes as calculated by value at point of first sale were very substantial, estimated at approximately €47.5 million per annum on average over the study period. Of this €42.8 million was for annual cost of losses of sea bass and sea bream in the Mediterranean and €4.7 million for losses of salmon in northern Europe.},

The recapture dynamics of a massive escape of nearly 100 tones taking place in Western Mediterranean was analysed. The artisanal fishery showed efficient in recapturing escaped fish as 64.7\% of the escaped biomass was recovered. The spatial distribution of escaped gilthead seabream along the shore was studied as well as the efficiency of the fishing fleet distinguishing between fishing gears. The recapture of escaped fish showed well correlated with the distance to the escape point. Moreover, a high recapture success (64.7\%) was registered being fish traps (53.8\%) more efficient in recovering escapees than nets (10.9\%).

Two hundred and seventy juvenile totoaba (mean initial weight 12.12±0.09g) were randomly distributed in 18 (375L) tanks (6 treatments in triplicate groups) and fed the experimental diets for 10weeks. At the end of the experiment, fish fed the high protein and low lipid diet (P:E of 25.7mg protein:kJ−1) resulted in significantly higher weight gain (489\%) compared to the other treatments. Dietary protein levels significantly affected weight gain but within a protein level, higher lipid levels resulted in reduced growth. No significant differences in survival were observed at the end of the experiment. The fish fed diets containing 18\% lipid resulted in reduced feed intake and explained the reduced growth rates observed in fish fed the high lipid diets. However the protein efficiency ratio (PER) was unaffected. The high lipid with low and medium protein content diets significantly reduced growth due to a reduction of feed intake from the unbalanced P:E ratio. No differences in body fat accumulation were observed, both in muscle or viscera, due to a high quality protein and lipid sources ingredients used in the present work. Further research is warranted evaluating lipid digestion in totoaba to optimize lipid utilization.},

Understanding how alternative agricultural production systems, agricultural input efficiency, and food choice drive environmental degradation is necessary for reducing agriculture’s environmental impacts. A meta-analysis of life cycle assessments that includes 742 agricultural systems and over 90 unique foods produced primarily in high-input systems shows that, per unit of food, organic systems require more land, cause more eutrophication, use less energy, but emit similar greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) as conventional systems; that grass-fed beef requires more land and emits similar GHG emissions as grain-feed beef; and that low-input aquaculture and non-trawling fisheries have much lower GHG emissions than trawling fisheries. In addition, our analyses show that increasing agricultural input efficiency (the amount of food produced per input of fertilizer or feed) would have environmental benefits for both crop and livestock systems. Further, for all environmental indicators and nutritional units examined, plant-based foods have the lowest environmental impacts; eggs, dairy, pork, poultry, non-trawling fisheries, and non-recirculating aquaculture have intermediate impacts; and ruminant meat has impacts ∼100 times those of plant-based foods. Our analyses show that dietary shifts towards low-impact foods and increases in agricultural input use efficiency would offer larger environmental benefits than would switches from conventional agricultural systems to alternatives such as organic agriculture or grass-fed beef.},

We conclude that meeting current and larger consumption rates is feasible, despite a growing population and the impacts of climate change on potential fisheries production, but only if fish resources are managed sustainably and the animal feeds industry reduces its reliance on wild fish.

In the cases when connections are acknowledged, there is often little assessment of if or how well MPAs can achieve specific EBM goals. Here we start by critically evaluating commonalities and differences between MPAs and EBM. Next, we use global analyses to show where and how much no-take marine reserves can be expected to contribute to EBM goals, specifically by reducing the cumulative impacts of stressors on ocean ecosystems. These analyses revealed large stretches of coastal oceans where reserves can play a major role in reducing cumulative impacts and thus improving overall ocean condition, at the same time highlighting the limitations of marine reserves as a single tool to achieve comprehensive EBM. Ultimately, better synergies between these two burgeoning approaches provide opportunities to greatly benefit ocean health.},

	abstract = {The ultimate objective of an aquaculture feed manufacturer and aquaculture food supplier is to ensure that the feed or food produced is both safe and wholesome. Reported food safety risks, which may be associated with the use of commercial animal feeds, including compound aquaculture feeds, usually result from the possible presence of unwanted contaminants, either within the feed ingredients used or from the external contamination of the finished feed on prolonged storage. The major animal feed contaminants that have been reported to date have included Salmonellae, mycotoxins, veterinary drug residues, persistent organic pollutants, agricultural and other chemicals (solvent residues, melamine), heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium) and excess mineral salts (hexavalent chromium, arsenic, selenium, flourine), and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Apart from the direct negative effect of these possible contaminants on the health of the cultured target species, there is a risk that the feed contaminants may be passed along the food chain, via contaminated aquaculture produce, to consumers. In recent years, public concern regarding food safety has increased as a consequence of the increasing prevalence of antibiotic residues, persistent organic pollutants, and chemicals in farmed seafood. The important role played by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission in the development of international standards, guidelines, and recommendations to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the food trade is discussed.},

The loss of animal species in terrestrial environments has been well documented and is continuing. Loss of species in marine environments has been slower than in terrestrial systems, but appears to be increasing rapidly. McCauley et al. review the recent patterns of species decline and loss in marine environments. Though they note many worrying declines, they also highlight approaches that might allow us to prevent the type of massive defaunation that has occurred on land.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUND Comparing patterns of terrestrial and marine defaunation helps to place human impacts on marine fauna in context and to navigate toward recovery. Defauna­tion began in earnest tens of thousands of years later in the oceans than it did on land. Although defaunation has been less severe in the oceans than on land, our effects on marine animals are increasing in pace and impact. Humans have caused few complete extinctions in the sea, but we are responsible for many ecological, commercial, and local extinctions. Despite our late start, humans have already powerfully changed virtually all major marine ecosystems.
ADVANCES Humans have profoundly decreased the abundance of both large (e.g., whales) and small (e.g., anchovies) marine fauna. Such declines can generate waves of ecological change that travel both up and down ma­rine food webs and can alter ocean ecosystem functioning. Human harvesters have also been a major force of evolutionary change in the oceans and have reshaped the genetic structure of marine animal populations. Climate change threatens to accelerate marine defaunation over the next century. The high mobility of many marine animals offers some increased, though limited, capacity for marine species to respond to climate stress, but it also exposes many species to increased risk from other stressors. Because humans are intensely reliant on ocean ecosystems for food and other ecosystem services, we are deeply affected by all of these forecasted changes. Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terrestrial defaunation experiences: (i) today’s low rates of marine extinction may be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens; (ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the next 150 years.
OUTLOOK Wildlife populations in the oceans have been badly damaged by human activity. Nevertheless, marine fauna generally are in better condition than terrestrial fauna: Fewer marine animal extinctions have occurred; many geographic ranges have shrunk less; and numerous ocean ecosystems remain more wild than terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, meaningful rehabilitation of affected marine animal populations remains within the reach of managers. Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the advance of marine defaunation. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6219/1255641/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Timeline (log scale) of marine and terrestrial defaunation. The marine defaunation experience is much less advanced, even though humans have been harvesting ocean wildlife for thousands of years. The recent industrialization of this harvest, however, initiated an era of intense marine wildlife declines. If left unmanaged, we predict that marine habitat alteration, along with climate change (colored bar: IPCC warming), will exacerbate marine defaunation.
Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of aquaculture–environment interactions is essential for the development of a sustainable aquaculture industry and efficient marine spatial planning. The effects of fish and shellfish farming on sessile wild populations, particularly infauna, have been studied intensively. Mobile fauna, including crustaceans, fish, birds and marine mammals, also interact with aquaculture operations, but the interactions are more complex and these animals may be attracted to (attraction) or show an aversion to (repulsion) farm operations with various degrees of effects. This review outlines the main mechanisms and effects of attraction and repulsion of wild animals to/from marine finfish cage and bivalve aquaculture, with a focus on effects on fisheries-related species. Effects considered in this review include those related to the provision of physical structure (farm infrastructure acting as fish aggregating devices (FADs) or artificial reefs (ARs), the provision of food (e.g. farmed animals, waste feed and faeces, fouling organisms associated with farm structures) and some farm activities (e.g. boating, cleaning). The reviews show that the distribution of mobile organisms associated with farming structures varies over various spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal scales (season, feeding time, day/night period). Attraction/repulsion mechanisms have a variety of direct and indirect effects on wild organisms at the level of individuals and populations and may have implication for the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in the context of marine spatial planning. This review revealed considerable uncertainties regarding the long-term and ecosystem-wide consequences of these interactions. The use of modelling may help better understand consequences, but long-term studies are necessary to better elucidate effects.},

	abstract = {The abundance of Atlantic salmon is declining throughout its geographical area. Fisheries and global warming were assumed as main drivers of the decline, and recent studies suggest that habitat changes in freshwater is a third contributor. Southern populations experience the greatest decline, and face the highest risk of extinction as global warming moves its thermal niche northwards. We analysed long-term catch data (1949–2013) from a salmon fishery in northern Spain, and examined its relationship with local and global indicators of temperature and hydrological change. CPUE data, analysed by ARIMA time-series models, exhibited a significant negative trend and a marked decrease since 1973–1974, possibly triggered by overfishing at sea and a sudden outbreak of disease. Temperature increased in the same period, particularly so since 1986–1988, being negatively correlated with CPUE. A significant change in magnitude and duration of extreme water conditions occurred from 1970s onwards. Indicators of hydrological shift were also significantly correlated with CPUE of returning salmon. The best ARIMAX models indicated however, that the decrease in salmon CPUE was mainly driven by temperature trends. This indicates that both local (temperature and flow in the river) and global (ocean temperature) factors have contributed to the decrease in salmon numbers, and that temperature has played the major role. Despite a strong reduction in fishing pressure after the 1970s widespread collapse, our study population did not recover to previous abundance levels. This suggests the operation of additional factors, being climate warming and changes in food webs of the North Atlantic the most likely reasons.},

In contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear.


* Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures that maximize performance in the wild (ToptE) are related to species biogeographies.


* We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance curves to these data, compared ToptE to species-specific warm range boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to our wild fish data.


* We found ToptE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two temperatures (the ‘environmental heating tolerance’) was smaller for more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that ToptE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (ToptAS) approaches upper critical temperatures (upper Tcrit) for aerobic scope in the laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper Tcrit − ToptAS) in captive fishes.


* Our comparison of field- and laboratory-derived data highlights the ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

	abstract = {The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) is affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services. We review the main ecological services across a variety of ECEs, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.},

	abstract = {Polyploids can be defined as organisms with one or more additional chromosome sets with respect to the number most frequently found in nature for a given species. Triploids, organisms with three sets of homologous chromosomes, are found spontaneously in both wild and cultured populations and can be easily induced in many commercially relevant species of fish and shellfish. The major consequence of triploidy is gonadal sterility, which is of advantage in the aquaculture of molluscs since it can result in superior growth. In fish, the induction of triploidy is mainly used to avoid problems associated with sexual maturation such as lower growth rates, increased incidence of diseases and deterioration of the organoleptic properties. Triploidy can also be used to increase the viability of some hybrids, and is regarded as a potential method for the genetic containment of farmed shellfish and fish. This review focuses on some current issues related to the application of induced polyploidy in aquaculture, namely: 1) the artificial induction of polyploidy and the effectiveness of current triploidisation techniques, including the applicability of tetraploidy to generate auto- and allotriploids; 2) the performance capacity of triploids with respect to diploids; 3) the degree and permanence of gonadal sterility in triploids; and 4) the prospects for the potential future generalised use of triploids to avoid the genetic impact of escapees of farmed fish and shellfish on wild populations. Finally, directions for future research on triploids and their implementation are discussed.},

We take a holistic approach to review off-bottom and suspended mussel culture effects on the benthic environment and benthic communities. Both longline and “bouchot” mussel culture add much physical structure (infrastructure and mussels) to the environment, altering hydrosedimentary processes by modifying currents and increasing sedimentation locally, and providing habitat for many benthic organisms. Biodeposition from mussels and these organisms increases benthic organic loading and linked biogeochemical processes to influence O2, pH, redox potentials, dissolved sulphides, and other sediment parameters, benthic respiration and nutrient fluxes, and benthic infaunal communities. Mussel culture may also influence seagrasses and algae, although this has not been well-studied.

The value of mussel farming is then calculated as savings in costs from replacement of more costly nutrient abatement options. In addition to mussel farming, the cost minimisation model includes 20 abatement measures which affect agriculture, industry, transports and households in each of the 24 drainage basins of the Baltic Sea. The results indicate that calculated marginal cleaning costs of nutrients by mussel farming can be considerably lower than other abatement measures, but also relatively high depending on mussel growth, sales options, and formulation of nutrient load targets for the Baltic Sea. The estimated values range between approximately 0.1 and 1.1 billions of Euros per year depending on Baltic Sea nutrient target and net cleaning cost of mussel farming, which correspond to cost savings between 2 and 11 percent. The results also show that the value from contributions to savings of control costs for achieving the Baltic Sea action plan suggested by Helcom ranges between 5 and 60 percent of the market price of live mussel for human consumption.},

	abstract = {Marine stock enhancement is a set of management approaches involving the release of cultured organisms to enhance or restore fisheries. Such practices, including sea ranching, stock enhancement, and restocking, are widespread, of variable success, and often controversial. A set of principles aimed at promoting responsible development of restocking, stock enhancement, and sea ranching has been proposed by Blankenship and Leber [American Fisheries Society Symposia 15: 167–175 (1995)], and has gained widespread acceptance as the ‘Responsible Approach’. Fisheries science and management, in general, and many aspects of fisheries enhancement have developed rapidly since the responsible approach was first formulated. Here we provide an update to the Responsible Approach in light of these developments. The updated approach emphasizes the need for taking a broad and integrated view of the role of enhancements within fisheries management systems; using a stakeholder participatory and scientifically informed, accountable planning process; and assessing the potential contribution of enhancement and alternative or additional measures to fisheries management goals early on in the development or reform process. Progress in fisheries assessment methods applicable to enhancements and in fisheries governance provides the means for practical implementation of the updated approach.},

Higher population densities and incidence of recruits in 2004–2006, as well as steady increase in the catch per unit effort of gatherers, indicate that the sea urchin population is recovering. Growth of reseeded, hatchery-produced sea urchins in two sites was high and comparable to those in grow-out cages. However, natural mortalities were very high (91–99\%). Good growth, high survivorship, and potential reproductive output of sea urchins in grow-out cages, aside from immediate socio-economic benefits, demonstrate that grow-out culture is a cost effective option for reestablishing effective spawning populations. Higher recruitment success in Lucero, compared to other sites, may be attributed to local favorable biophysical conditions and to maintenance of an effective spawning population due to enforcement of marine sanctuary rules, size regulation, and the presence of broodstock cages. Results suggest that the establishment of a network of marine protected areas in tandem with grow-out culture may be strategic in enhancing the recovery of depleted populations by maintaining larval exchange to sustain the productivity of sea urchin fishery stocks along NW Luzon.},

Restocking activities were done in collaboration with local groups by providing training in the culture and ocean rearing of giant clams, and by implementing a “users pay” approach. Initially, a variety of giant clam species was used but once F1 broodstock of Tridacna gigas were reared, restocking focused on this species due to its scarcity and fast rate of growth. About 20 000 T. gigas were placed on coral reefs. In addition, \&gt;50 000 clams (T. gigas, T. squamosa, T. derasa, T. crocea, T. maxima and Hippopus hippopus) were distributed through other means. Altogether, \&gt;40 sites throughout the Philippines received cultured giant clams. Grow-out trials to test the viability of supplying giant clams for the aquarium trade to create new sources of income were conducted successfully with a group of fishers in Bolinao, Pangasinan. However, this initiative encountered legal obstacles when the government regulatory agency prohibited the export of cultured clams, regarding this as a threat to the conservation of wild individuals. The long experience in culturing and restocking giant clams in the Philippines provides many lessons for other countries wishing to restore stocks of these large bivalves. Particular care needs to be given to selection of release sites, negotiations with participating groups to safeguard the released clams, adequate transfer of technology to collaborators, and transport of large clams from nursery areas to release sites.},

	abstract = {Herbivorous or omnivorous tilapia and carp species form the backbone of tropical inland aquaculture and fisheries enhancement and have been introduced widely outside their natural ranges. Perceptions of their impact on native fish faunas vary widely, but there have been few rigorous assessments. To quantify the impact of tilapia and carp stocking on native fish communities in freshwater wetlands of the Mekong region, we conducted observational and experimental impact–control studies replicated at the wetland level, at a total of 46 sites in Lao PDR. The studies were designed as paired comparisons of wetlands where the non-native species (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, mrigal Cirrhinus cirrhosus, rohu Labeo rohita and bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) were stocked in substantial numbers with similar wetlands where the species were absent. Stocking of these non-native species was associated with significant increases in total fish biomass, by 180\% in the observational study and by 49\% in the experiment. Native fish biomass was not affected by stocking of the non-native species. No significant impacts on native fish species richness, diversity indices, species composition or feeding guild composition were detected, except for moderately negative effects on Simpson diversity and equitability in the observational study. In the experiment, no effect had a point estimate exceeding − 14\%, or a 95\% confidence limit exceeding − 35\% of the non-impacted value. Use of these non-native tilapia and carp species in fisheries enhancement in mainland SE Asia supported substantial increases in harvestable biomass while having only mild impacts on native fish communities. Escapes of the same species from pond and cage aquaculture facilities are likely to result in lower biomass in the wild and have lower impacts than enhancement stocking. We encourage building on our results through a systematic and stakeholder-participatory evaluation of the significance and acceptability of benefits and risks associated with the use of these non-native species. This evaluation should be extended to the relative benefits and risks of replacing non-native species with native ones in aquaculture and enhancement, considering that risks associated with using the current set of non-native species are increasingly well known and appear mild-to-moderate, whilst ecological and genetic risks of releasing domesticated types of native species are poorly known.},

In addition we compare the volatility of fish prices to other commodities to investigate their volatility in a broader context. Given the importance of trade in fisheries and aquaculture, our analysis also sheds light on the relative importance of price risk as part of trade revenue risk and the riskiness of various fish enterprises at the market level.

Among other things, the findings in the Spanish case show a complex relationship between the amount of fish landed and price; a clear substitution relationship between fresh fish and aquaculture; a negative impact of labour costs in a manual labour-intensive sector such as fishing, which in developed countries is being affected by an exodus of manpower to other sectors where there is less uncertainty surrounding labour conditions; the impact of Spain being barred from international fishing grounds a result of the delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZs); and the dwindling importance of fisheries traffic as a result of the port devolution process begun in Spain in the early 1990s. The non-significance of a priori key factors, such as the price of oil and Spain's entry into the EEC, can be explained by widespread energy subsidies and contradictions in the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, respectively.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-producing sector in the world. It is developing, expanding and intensifying in almost all regions of the world. The global population is increasing, thus, the demand for aquatic food products is also increasing. Production from capture fisheries has levelled off and most of the main fishing areas have reached their maximum potential. Sustaining fish supplies from capture fisheries will, therefore, not be able to meet the growing global demand for aquatic food and aquaculture is considered to be an opportunity to bridge the supply and demand gap of aquatic food in most regions of the world. However, in our efforts to achieve this potential, the sector will face significant challenges. Key development trends indicate that the sector continues to intensify and diversify and is continuing to use new species and modify its systems and practices. Markets, trade and consumption preferences strongly influence the growth of the sector, with clear demands for the production of safe and quality products. As a consequence, increasing emphasis is placed on enhanced enforcement of regulation and better governance of the sector. It is increasingly realized that sustainable development and responsible production of aquaculture, in the long run, cannot be achieved without the full participation of the producers in the decision-making and regulation process, which has led to efforts to empower farmers and their associations and move toward increasing self-regulation. These factors are all contributing to an improvement in the management of the sector, typically through the promotion of ‘better management’ practices of producers. This review discusses the role of aquaculture, as at large a small-scale farmer driven production sector, in the quest for sustainable development, reducing poverty and improving food security on a global scale.},

We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were ‘structural’ issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management.},

It is found that the entry of a competitive aquaculturist increases natural fish stocks, reduces price, and increases total supply. If initially the natural fish stock is at a level below maximum sustainable yield, entry of the aquaculturist results in an increase in supply from the commercial fishery. In the second part, the aquaculturist is modeled as a dominant firm. In some situations, the aquaculturist behaves in a manner similar to the competitive case, but impacts on price, fish stock, and efficiency will not be as large. It is shown that there also exist cases where the dominant aquaculturist will desire to promote overexploitation of the natural fish stock.},

To do this, we used four case studies of the red sea bream Pagrus major and the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus to establish whether hatchery releases augmented total production without replacement of wild fish. The catches by age of released and wild fish showed that hatchery-reared fish contributed 36.4 ± 17.8\% to total production of red sea bream and 22.6 ± 11.3\% to flounder, respectively. About 50\% of the variation in total catches was explained by capture of hatchery-reared fish for red sea bream, and 29–38\% for flounder. However, the scope for increased production was limited by carrying capacity, particularly at release sites. Replacement of wild fish by hatchery-reared juveniles was suggested in one case. The comparative analysis of macro-scale catch history revealed that the average contribution of hatchery-reared fish was 9.5\% for red sea bream and 11.7\% for flounder, and the global dynamics of wild populations does not appear to be linked to stock enhancement activities. Our results suggest the need for a cautious approach to stock enhancement programmes. We also address the biological potential, the limitations, and the future prospects of marine stock enhancement.},

Is this also a viable strategy to enhance depleted populations of this species and other marine invertebrates? We monitored growth and survival of 765 translocated individuals and 486 in their original habitat for 5–9 months. Individuals translocated to a severely overexploited reef (mainland Palawan) grew 2–3 times faster than those at Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, Phillipines. Despite variations in growth between the three sites, survival probabilities were consistently high, ranging between 0.77 and 0.92. So translocation is feasible, and sites at which a species has previously been found are likely to be suitable for their growth and survival. If site management can control over-fishing, this approach is likely to be a valuable tool for enhancing field populations of a large invertebrates like Trochus that have a short lived planktonic larva.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The lucrative, illegal trade in tigers (Panthera tigris) remains a major conservation problem. Tiger farming has been proposed as a potential solution, with farmed tigers substituting for wild tigers. At first glance, this argument's logic seems simple: farming will increase the supply of tigers, prices will fall, and poaching will no longer be profitable. We contend, however, that this supply-side argument relies on mistaken assumptions. First, tiger markets are imperfect, meaning they are dominated by a few producers who control price. Second, consumers prefer wild tigers to farmed tigers and therefore the two are not pure substitutes. In economic terms, products from wild tigers are luxury goods, commanding a price premium. Third, there is no evidence that farmed tigers can be produced or sold more cheaply than wild tigers. In sum, it is unlikely that farming will drive down the price of wild-caught tigers or decrease profitability for tiger poachers. Rather, tiger farming is more likely to increase aggregate demand for tiger products and stimulate higher levels of poaching.},
